Finished watching the Coding with Cursor Session 4 Video. Totally worth the 3-ish hours (although I watched it at speeds from 1.5x-2x) #coding #ai

Banger quote from Sahil somewhere in the middle of the video above ☝🏽:

> What I would love to see is more generalists, you know, people who don't think about, "Oh, I need to get really deep, like get a PhD in TypeScript or web app development," because those things are not that hard now. And, you know, there's so many levels of distraction—you can outsource stuff, there's open source, there's Vercel, whatever—but actually just getting more and more horizontal, and that, I think, unlocks the really powerful ideas anyway, right? Like, the way you have ideas like Cursor is you have some design sensibility that came from somewhere, and then some engineering sensibility that came from somewhere, and some product sense from watching, you know, some reading, some Paul Graham essays over here, and listening to this over here, and doing whatever it is—whatever your life experience is, I think is adding more to it, right? Just like stuffing your prompt, like stuffing as much context into the prompt, and then just saying, "Do something cool." I mean, I think that's partly a good exercise for humans to do every once in a while, right?

The world is getting older, and some of the chaos that characterized the 60s is rarer now: [The one advantage of an ageing world](https://www.ft.com/content/35fe7db0-7c1c-4d47-8a0b-1f2ce72e5940)


> Well, there’s this: the median American in 1968 was 26. Now? 38. And this isn’t an extreme age arc by world standards. At the time of the Cultural Revolution, when students hounded their elders for insufficient fealty to Maoist doctrine, the median person in China was a scarcely believable 18. That number is now almost 40. 
> 
 In France during its own 1968, when the republic tottered, the median age was a decade less than it is now. The median German is older than in the Baader-Meinhof heyday, as is the median Italian compared with the Years of Lead, when the far left and the far right murdered people.

> While obsessions with health and longevity have long dogged humanity, this latest version is intensified by an ecosystem in which influencers and podcasters profit from our attention and quest for health by getting sponsorships from supplement companies, sleep trackers and other pseudoscientific wellness products.

Good set of resources by Phil Eaton to get started with database stuff: [Getting started with database development : r/databasedevelopment](https://www.reddit.com/r/databasedevelopment/comments/unj8d1/getting_started_with_database_development/) #databases
