Finished watching the Coding with Cursor Session 4 Video. Totally worth the 3-ish hours (although I watched it at speeds from 1.5x-2x)

Banger quote from Sahil somewhere in the middle of the video above ☝🏽:

> What I would love to see is more generalists, you know, people who don't think about, "Oh, I need to get really deep, like get a PhD in TypeScript or web app development," because those things are not that hard now. And, you know, there's so many levels of distraction—you can outsource stuff, there's open source, there's Vercel, whatever—but actually just getting more and more horizontal, and that, I think, unlocks the really powerful ideas anyway, right? Like, the way you have ideas like Cursor is you have some design sensibility that came from somewhere, and then some engineering sensibility that came from somewhere, and some product sense from watching, you know, some reading, some Paul Graham essays over here, and listening to this over here, and doing whatever it is—whatever your life experience is, I think is adding more to it, right? Just like stuffing your prompt, like stuffing as much context into the prompt, and then just saying, "Do something cool." I mean, I think that's partly a good exercise for humans to do every once in a while, right?
