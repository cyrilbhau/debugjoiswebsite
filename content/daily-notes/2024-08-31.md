Finished watching the Coding with Cursor Session 4 Video. Totally worth the 3-ish hours (although I watched it at speeds from 1.5x-2x) #coding #ai

Banger quote from Sahil somewhere in the middle of the video above ☝🏽:

> What I would love to see is more generalists, you know, people who don't think about, "Oh, I need to get really deep, like get a PhD in TypeScript or web app development," because those things are not that hard now. And, you know, there's so many levels of distraction—you can outsource stuff, there's open source, there's Vercel, whatever—but actually just getting more and more horizontal, and that, I think, unlocks the really powerful ideas anyway, right? Like, the way you have ideas like Cursor is you have some design sensibility that came from somewhere, and then some engineering sensibility that came from somewhere, and some product sense from watching, you know, some reading, some Paul Graham essays over here, and listening to this over here, and doing whatever it is—whatever your life experience is, I think is adding more to it, right? Just like stuffing your prompt, like stuffing as much context into the prompt, and then just saying, "Do something cool." I mean, I think that's partly a good exercise for humans to do every once in a while, right?

The world is getting older, and some of the chaos that characterized the 60s is rarer now: [The one advantage of an ageing world](https://www.ft.com/content/35fe7db0-7c1c-4d47-8a0b-1f2ce72e5940)


> Well, there’s this: the median American in 1968 was 26. Now? 38. And this isn’t an extreme age arc by world standards. At the time of the Cultural Revolution, when students hounded their elders for insufficient fealty to Maoist doctrine, the median person in China was a scarcely believable 18. That number is now almost 40. 
> 
 In France during its own 1968, when the republic tottered, the median age was a decade less than it is now. The median German is older than in the Baader-Meinhof heyday, as is the median Italian compared with the Years of Lead, when the far left and the far right murdered people.


[Opinion | The Key to Longevity Is Boring - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/11/opinion/longevity-live-longer.html)

> While obsessions with health and longevity have long dogged humanity, this latest version is intensified by an ecosystem in which influencers and podcasters profit from our attention and quest for health by getting sponsorships from supplement companies, sleep trackers and other pseudoscientific wellness products.

[How to stop living on auto-pilot | Psyche Guides](https://psyche.co/guides/how-to-stop-living-on-auto-pilot-by-picking-goals-that-matter) #psychology #self-improvement 

> The importance of this behavioural focus cannot be overstated. In the moments when you feel hopeless, or just tired, a concrete image of the life you want can be motivating. And it’s most motivating when you believe you can reach that life because you’ve already started working towards it and can recall concrete evidence of positive movement toward your goals.
>
> The reality is, behaviour change is hard, and many people have not been taught effective goal-setting. For example, someone might know that they’re unhappy and have intentions to change, but they focus on something too broad (‘I want to be happy’) or on what they _don’t_ want (‘I don’t want to be depressed’). An ill-defined focus can lead to trying many things without following through on any one thing. Also, humans often fall prey to the planning fallacy, a [tendency](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0065260110430014) to underestimate the amount of time and effort a task will take. Many people set unrealistic goals and then give up or blame themselves for ‘failing’ when they struggle to reach them. It’s easy to unknowingly stymie your progress by not getting specific, realistic or behavioural enough with your life goals.

[Oedipus Wrecks Havoc With Moral Judgment - by Rob Kurzban](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/oedipus-wrecks-havok-with-moral-judgment) #evo-psych #morality

Quotes from ChatGPT Summary:
> - **Evolutionary Perspective:** The author suggests that human beings are evolutionarily wired to form and participate in moral mobs. Throughout history, siding with the majority or the most vocal group could offer protection and advantages in social conflicts. This ingrained behavior is linked to the concept of "moral side-taking," where individuals instinctively align with those who appear to uphold the moral order, regardless of whether they have all the facts.
>   …
>   **Moral System’s Design:** The human moral system is designed to act quickly and decisively in the face of perceived wrongdoing, often favoring group cohesion and action over careful deliberation and truth-seeking. This design, while beneficial in certain evolutionary contexts, can lead to injustices in complex, modern societies where the truth is often more nuanced and hidden from immediate view.

[How I Read - Rob Henderson's Newsletter](https://www.robkhenderson.com/p/how-i-read) #reading #self-improvement 

Here are the key concepts described in the article above ☝🏽:
- **No Secret to Voracious Reading**: The author emphasizes that there is no secret to reading a lot. It involves slow, deliberate reading, taking notes, and reflecting on the content.
- **Reading as a Conversation**: Reading is described as being "in conversation" with the author, allowing for deep concentration and thoughtful engagement with the text.
- **Reading vs. Audiobooks**: While audiobooks are easier and better than nothing, reading is preferred for deep engagement with ideas and better retention of knowledge.
- **Podcasts, TV, and Movies**: These are considered less effective for learning compared to reading, often serving as a form of high-class entertainment or background activity.
- **Deep Reading**: Deep reading is rare but important, leading to a greater depth of understanding and the ability to weave insights from various domains.
- **Building a Reading Habit**: The importance of making reading a non-negotiable part of the daily routine, similar to a gym routine, and starting with small, manageable goals.
- **Technology Management**: Suggestions include minimizing distractions by avoiding games and social media on phones, and using strategies like separating "kale phone" (useful apps only) from "cocaine phone" (distracting apps).
- **Books as a Necessity**: The author views books as essential, akin to food, and prioritizes buying and reading them even when financially constrained.
- **Selective Reading**: The author does not finish every book, skims through some, and occasionally revisits books later when ready for them.
- **Effortful Reading for Deep Learning**: Emphasizes that deep learning requires effort and consuming a large volume of information to build a rich mental knowledge base.
- **Influence of Reading Choices**: The content consumed, whether through books, podcasts, or social media, shapes future thoughts and ideas.

While reading this article, stumbled upon another article about reading from Byrne Hobart: [Read.. You will not learn anything of lasting… | by Byrne Hobart | Medium](https://archive.ph/p44mV)

>  You will not learn anything of lasting importance from TV, movies, podcasts, or that execrable Existential Comics thing. Even at 3x speed, they’re junk food. The way serious people learn is by reading.
>  …
>  Successful people converge on three ways to learn: lots of reading time, some exercises and projects, and some conversations with people who are slightly ahead of them. I simply can’t name a single person who became an expert on a topic by watching lots of videos!

Ouch!
