[High Modernism made our world - by Henry Farrell](https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/high-modernism-made-our-world) #culture

> So what does this have to do with modern information technology? Quite straightforwardly: if you read Scott, you will see marked similarities between e.g. the ambitions of 1960s bureaucrats, convinced that they can plan out countries and cities for “abstract citizens” and the visions of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, convinced that algorithms and objective functions would create a more efficient and more harmonious world.
> 
> …
> 
> Scott suggested the value of _metis_ - “the kind of knowledge that can be acquired only by long practice at similar but rarely identical tasks, which requires constant adaptation to changing circumstances.” This is the kind of tacit knowledge that peasants come to build about their land and the weather, or that people in less regimented societies accumulate about how to live with others in tolerable peace. Scott - an anarchist - greatly preferred this latter kind of knowledge, and the societies that valued it more, to the kind of world we live in today.


[Romantic Love is an Under-Rated Driver of Gender Equality](https://www.ggd.world/p/romantic-love-is-an-under-rated-driver) #love #feminism  #patriarchy

> On International Women’s Day, I’d like to highlight a hugely important (but widely overlooked) driver of gender equality. In fact, this mechanism is so powerful that it is actively suppressed by many patriarchal societies.

Snippet from ChatGPT summary
#### Historical Europe: From Patriarchy to Celebrating Love

- Europe transitioned from strict patriarchal structures to celebrating romantic love, partly due to Christianity’s emphasis on conjugal partnerships and nuclear families.
- **Roman Republic**: Initially patriarchal, but unique in its idealization of monogamy, setting the stage for future gender equality advances.
- **Quote**: "Marriage came to be idealized as a voluntary relationship between two people, beginning with affectio maritalis."

#### Christianity and Marriage Reform

- **Christianity** shifted societal norms, encouraging monogamous, affectionate marriages.
- Marriage was seen as a reciprocal relationship, influencing cultural norms across Europe. This allowed women to gain more autonomy, especially in nuclear households.
- **Quote**: "The husband must give the wife what is due to her, and the wife equally has to give the husband his due."

#### Protestant Reformation and Romantic Love

- The **Protestant Reformation** further emphasized marital love and intimacy, breaking down fraternal loyalty and promoting individual relationships.
- Sermons criticized husbands for insufficient love, promoting equality within marriage.
- **Quote**: "By the 17th century, churches actually criticized husbands for showing insufficient love."

> Well, cities used to be much less expensive places to live. That kind of bohemian lifestyle, was very much a thing for many people. But in in the US context, health care and college costs have risen dramatically. Gentrification has increased dramatically. The bohemians of old, they used to survive in the city by working maybe 1 or 2 days a week.
> 
> They they had time to develop a more intense subcultural experience and set up neighborhood enclaves such as New York's Greenwich Village and San Francisco's North Beach. But today's alternative subcultural participants, whether hipsters, bohemians, or punks, must normally work full time or nearly full time to survive. The baristas we interviewed, worked about 32 hours a week, almost full time. So their place of employment just limits their subcultural activities and becomes a more substantial part of their lives. Bohemians hardly ever talked about their day jobs.
> 
> They just weren't that important to them. For baristas, when you're working 32 hours a week, your day job's important. And we need to carefully investigate it if we're to ascertain the extent to which hipsters, baristas are able to live lives that are thoroughly hip and alternative.

> Host: How would you describe the book's central thesis? Were you really able to draw any firm conclusions about the about the future of urban baristas?
> 
> Speaker: Although we focused a lot on the work and lives of, baristas, our central concern in the end was about their ability to lead subcultural lives, an alternative to having a regular mainstream, job and plenty of time to do alternative stuff like art and music and hanging out in cool places and going to thrift shops, etcetera. But the realities of their city, their country, their coffee shop employment often conflicted with this endeavor. They faced rude customers, tired feet, and strained wrists during their typically 32 hour work week. Gee, is this really an alternative? They lived in neighborhoods that conflicted with their progressive orientation.
> 
> Also, coffee shops, they're expensive, they're busy, and serve predominantly white customers. And most of the baristas who attracted to the coffee shop are white as well. So for that reason and many other reasons, their lives are not alternative to mainstream existence. Your neoliberal policies and structures of class, race, gender, gentrification, it intersects with their employment in ways that diminish the extent to which their lives are thoroughly compatible with their hipster subcultural ethos. And they don't even have adequate income for subcultural consumption.
> 
> Most couldn't afford the expensive coffee drinks they're serving, you know, and it's expensive even living in neighborhoods that are gentrifying.
