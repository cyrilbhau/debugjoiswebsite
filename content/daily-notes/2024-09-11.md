[High Modernism made our world - by Henry Farrell](https://www.programmablemutter.com/p/high-modernism-made-our-world)

> So what does this have to do with modern information technology? Quite straightforwardly: if you read Scott, you will see marked similarities between e.g. the ambitions of 1960s bureaucrats, convinced that they can plan out countries and cities for “abstract citizens” and the visions of Silicon Valley entrepreneurs, convinced that algorithms and objective functions would create a more efficient and more harmonious world.

> Scott suggested the value of _metis_ - “the kind of knowledge that can be acquired only by long practice at similar but rarely identical tasks, which requires constant adaptation to changing circumstances.” This is the kind of tacit knowledge that peasants come to build about their land and the weather, or that people in less regimented societies accumulate about how to live with others in tolerable peace. Scott - an anarchist - greatly preferred this latter kind of knowledge, and the societies that valued it more, to the kind of world we live in today.


[Romantic Love is an Under-Rated Driver of Gender Equality](https://www.ggd.world/p/romantic-love-is-an-under-rated-driver) #love #feminism  #patriarchy

> On International Women’s Day, I’d like to highlight a hugely important (but widely overlooked) driver of gender equality. In fact, this mechanism is so powerful that it is actively suppressed by many patriarchal societies.

Snippet from ChatGPT summary
#### Historical Europe: From Patriarchy to Celebrating Love

- Europe transitioned from strict patriarchal structures to celebrating romantic love, partly due to Christianity’s emphasis on conjugal partnerships and nuclear families.
- **Roman Republic**: Initially patriarchal, but unique in its idealization of monogamy, setting the stage for future gender equality advances.
- **Quote**: "Marriage came to be idealized as a voluntary relationship between two people, beginning with affectio maritalis."

#### Christianity and Marriage Reform

- **Christianity** shifted societal norms, encouraging monogamous, affectionate marriages.
- Marriage was seen as a reciprocal relationship, influencing cultural norms across Europe. This allowed women to gain more autonomy, especially in nuclear households.
- **Quote**: "The husband must give the wife what is due to her, and the wife equally has to give the husband his due."

#### Protestant Reformation and Romantic Love

- The **Protestant Reformation** further emphasized marital love and intimacy, breaking down fraternal loyalty and promoting individual relationships.
- Sermons criticized husbands for insufficient love, promoting equality within marriage.
- **Quote**: "By the 17th century, churches actually criticized husbands for showing insufficient love."
