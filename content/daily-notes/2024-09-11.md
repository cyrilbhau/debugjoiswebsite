Off to Mumbai

Travel means a LOT of podcasts ðŸ™ƒ #podcasts:
* Jamil Zaki has written a new book, and he appeared on a couple of podcasts on my feed to promote it. Managed to listen to them in quick sucession: [Amazon.com: Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness eBook : Zaki, Jamil: Kindle Store](https://www.amazon.com/Hope-Cynics-Surprising-Science-Goodness-ebook/dp/B0CR93L55W) #books
	* [Why cynicism is bad for you - The Gray Area with Sean Illing](https://lnns.co/KJrxd0Btgyj)
	* [How to Find Hope in a Cynical World - Not Lost](https://lnns.co/aqvnmTCclKU)
* [Coffee Culture - Thinking Allowed](https://lnns.co/5HU4-vB0omc) - Loved this. Will try to extract some gems from the transcript if I get time #coffee 
* [Why you canâ€™t â€˜hackâ€™ your way to productivity, with Oliver Burkeman](https://lnns.co/ANUPVDpXhaM) - Can't wait to get hold of the book. #books
* [â€˜Industryâ€™ Season 3, Episodes 4 and 5: Two Plus Two Equals F\*cked](https://lnns.co/y2GIrJ78qxU) - This is the third industry recap podcast on my rotation for every week! #tv
* [Catherine Pakaluk on _Hannahâ€™s Children: The Women Quietly Defying the Birth Dearth_](https://lnns.co/0vM9bNpx78T): This was a good podcast covering topics like the global demographic decline, pro-natalism and other related topics. I am really intrigued about the book.
