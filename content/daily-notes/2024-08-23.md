Go's `time` package does not have a way to fetch the number of days in a month. Here is a snippet I found that does that. Source: [Go: Number of days in month — brandur.org](https://brandur.org/fragments/go-days-in-month)

```go
```
import "time"

func daysIn(m time.Month, year int) int {
    return time.Date(year, m+1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC).Day()
}
```
```
