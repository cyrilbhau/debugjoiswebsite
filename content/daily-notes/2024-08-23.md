Go's `time` package does not have a way to fetch the number of days in a month. Here is a snippet I found that does that. Source: [Go: Number of days in month — brandur.org](https://brandur.org/fragments/go-days-in-month) #go #time

```go
import "time"

func daysIn(m time.Month, year int) int {
    return time.Date(year, m+1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC).Day()
}
```

From the post above:

> The reason it works is that we generate a date one month on from the target one (`m+1`), but set the day of month to 0. Days are 1-indexed, so this has the effect of rolling back one day to the last day of the previous month (our target month of `m`). Calling `Day()` then procures the number we want.

Nice vim trick to edit a macro inside a buffer and then yanking it back. Vim macros are mapped to registers of the same name: [This VIM trick BLEW MY MIND - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmEqmtr_6I) #vim #tools

Latest from the Imperfectionist Newsletter by Oliver Burkeman: [The Imperfectionist: Turning words](https://ckarchive.com/b/8kuqhoh0rwq26s3n66mnqfk9o2999h3) #zen

> - **Turning Words Concept**: Zen Buddhists speak of "turning words" — phrases that have a transformative effect, not by providing information but by sparking change on their own. The author acknowledges these phrases can be helpful but emphasizes the importance of hard work and experience.
> - **First Phrase**:
>     - _Source_: Zen master Houn Jiyu-Kennett.
>     - _Message_: The aim isn't to lighten the burden but to make it so heavy you put it down.
>     - _Impact_: The realization that trying to perfect life is futile and instead, accepting its weight can free you to live in the moment.
> - **Second Phrase**:
>     - _Source_: Writer Sasha Chapin.
>     - _Message_: “Playing in the ruins” refers to living fully after the collapse of perfectionist expectations.
>     - _Impact_: Embracing reality as it is, rather than forcing it to meet unrealistic expectations, allows for a more authentic experience of life.
> - **Third Phrase**:
>     - _Source_: Spiritual writer Michael Singer.
>     - _Message_: Reality doesn’t need your help to function, and your worrying doesn’t control or fix it.
>     - _Impact_: Letting go of the belief that worrying keeps things on track, and instead, being present for life as it unfolds.
> - **Core Takeaway**: These phrases point to a central truth: life isn't a problem to be solved, and accepting this is liberating. By letting go of the need to control life, we can live more fully and meaningfully.
