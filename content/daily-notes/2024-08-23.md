Go's `time` package does not have a way to fetch the number of days in a month. Here is a snippet I found that does that. Source: [Go: Number of days in month — brandur.org](https://brandur.org/fragments/go-days-in-month) #go #time

```go
import "time"

func daysIn(m time.Month, year int) int {
    return time.Date(year, m+1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, time.UTC).Day()
}
```

> The reason it works is that we generate a date one month on from the target one (`m+1`), but set the day of month to 0. Days are 1-indexed, so this has the effect of rolling back one day to the last day of the previous month (our target month of `m`). Calling `Day()` then procures the number we want.

Nice vim trick to edit a macro inside a buffer and then yanking it back. Vim macros are mapped to registers of the same name: [This VIM trick BLEW MY MIND - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bTmEqmtr_6I) #vim #tools
