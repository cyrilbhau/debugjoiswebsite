[There’s a Robot Warren Buffett ETF - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-18/there-s-a-robot-warren-buffett-etf?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNjcyMjA1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzI3MzI2ODU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSzBUNzJUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiI5QTg2QjY3RUZGOUE0OTA4OThBNjY4ODIwNTZGMDNFQiJ9.YewWPjapgRbzfS2r5ZFHMX3itxXfc324PaGDP7W8HRU)

Today's Money Stuff has Matt Levine opining on using AI for investing.

> And, again, people do that; there are a lot of investors who fancy themselves the next Warren Buffett. But that takes work — you have to read all the letters and apply them with a certain amount of trial and error[3](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2024-09-18/there-s-a-robot-warren-buffett-etf?srnd=undefined&sref=6rqLu4ZS#footer-ref-footnote-3) — and with modern technology it does seem like there would be a shortcut. The shortcut is:
> 
> 1. You feed all the letters into ChatGPT.
> 2. You ask it “recommend me a stock in the style of Warren Buffett.”
> 3. It picks a stock that Buffett _would_ pick, and writes up the thesis for the investment in the way that Buffett would.
> 4. You go buy the stock, because Warren Buffett — refracted through a model of his mind based on his writings — recommended it to you.
> 5. It goes up, because Warren Buffett is good at picking stocks, and his writings provide a good model of his mind, and ChatGPT is good at building that model from those writings.

…

> Stock investing is _so obviously_ a domain in which it makes sense to apply artificial intelligence:
> 
> 1. There is a ton of data.
> 2. Humans have pretty well-known weaknesses in dealing with it — limited memories and processing power, emotions, biases, lunch breaks — and a computer could avoid those weaknesses.
> 3. Everything happens on computers anyway. You don’t have to, like, avoid pedestrians in a self-driving car; you just generate buy and sell orders that get routed by computer to an exchange’s matching engine.
> 4. If you get it right you make a ton of money.
> 
> And when you put those things together, it is _so natural_ to think “yes, I will build a robot that is _better_ than people, that is more rational and logical and data-driven and calculating than people, that finds signals that people miss, that can do things that no human investor can do.” Your computer takes the raw information of financial markets and turns it into buying signals, free from the biases and weaknesses of human intelligence.
> 
> This is not that! This is the other, more soothing approach: “Surely no computer can be better at reading the spirits of the market than a 94-year-old guy in Omaha, or for that matter a charming and roguish day trader who died 80 years ago, so what we need to do is to program a computer to think like those guys.”

> Putting all of this together, I do think a combination of loneliness, social anxiety, unlimited internet access and economic crisis are possibly combining into _something_. We have viral TikToks of saying “people think I’m depressed because I’m always in bed” and a [viral tweet of people clamoring for an oddly shaped couch bed](https://x.com/jedwill/status/1815208803916488789), promising they’d never leave their house if they could own it (“96,000 of you are Jack Russell terriers” made me laugh out loud). I don’t think it’s out of the realm of possibility. If someone is saying the only thing they want to do is sleep, it’s not strange to wonder if something else might be going on. As Buffy once said, “I didn’t jump to conclusions. I simply took a step and there conclusions were.”
> 
> I promise I’m not attacking: I’m questioning. I do think an over-identification with the introvert label (as both Millennials and Gen Z are wont to do) and the rise of bed rotting and the ease of opting out of society has created an illusory community around… not doing anything. I don’t think these people need to be shamed (I’m sorry for the title of this post, but it’s too good to change) but I wonder if they need to be brought into community. People aren’t going to church, they aren’t joining civic groups, they think posting online is activism, they aren’t making friends, or their friends live too far away, or their friends are married, etc. When I wrote about situationships, I came to the same conclusion: loneliness makes us do strange things. Whether staying with someone who treats your heart like garbage or creating an online campaign to make us believe being home is the answer, I think a lot of posting is a genuine cry for the warmth of other people.
