Ava's latest newsletter post: [the true shape of a thing - by Ava - bookbear express](https://www.avabear.xyz/p/the-true-shape-of-a-thing)

> I’ve been meditating on this James Hollis quote a lot lately: “An ability to tolerate the anxiety generated by ambiguity is what allows us to respect, engage, and grow from our repeated, daily encounters with the essential mysteries of life. But the payoff goes even further. Certainty begets stagnation, but ambiguity pulls us deeper into life. Unchallenged conviction begets rigidity, which begets regression; but ambiguity opens us to discovery, complexity, and therefore growth. The health of our culture, and the magnitude of our personal journeys, require that we learn to tolerate ambiguity, in service to a larger life.”

Some good points here that are universally applicable, although I do feel it simplifies things a bit too much. No mention of the impact of AI coding assistants and their impact: [How to cope with technology FOMO – avdi.codes](https://avdi.codes/how-to-cope-with-technology-fomo/) #tech #fomo

[There is no Black Friday - by Brett Scott](https://www.asomo.co/p/there-is-no-black-friday)

> When encountering all the top-down Black Friday ads, I’m always reminded of Louis Althusser’s concept of [interpellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpellation_(philosophy)). It refers to the method of programming ideas into people’s minds by addressing them as if they already agree with what you’re saying. To understand this, let’s look at one of the purest examples of this phenomenon: Black Friday’s sister festival, _Cyber Monday._
> 
> Cyber Monday was written into existence by a press release from the National Retail Federation (the biggest retail trade association in the world), which said: _‘Cyber Monday Quickly Becoming One of the Biggest Online Shopping Days of the Year’_.
> 
> All the subsequent commercial slogans, like ‘Cyber Monday is Here’, and ‘Are you ready for Cyber Monday?’, speak at you as if you’re already a person who agrees this thing is a reality. This generates a feeling of a movement, of a whole mass of people somewhere - presumably - who already know about this thing that you’re only catching onto now.
