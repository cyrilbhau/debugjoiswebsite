Amazing relatable read on a lonely man in his late 30s finding friendship in a spin class: [The Salve of Spin Class: How a Lonely Man Found Connection on a Bike](https://longreads.com/2024/09/05/spin-masculinity-loneliness-friendship) #loneliness #friendship 

> There’s a tweet I wish I’d written about how the real miracle was Jesus having a dozen friends in his 30s, and as someone who has now outlived Jesus, I can testify to the divine work it takes to have friends. With few exceptions, all my friends are married, having kids, and buying houses in the ’burbs. Achieving domestic bliss has really started to cut into my friends’ hangout time.

> My 30s have been weird: isolating and demoralizing, a depressing gnarl in my stomach. A bone-deep, soul-swamped loneliness I can’t seem to text or swipe my way out of. Days alone in a crowded gym, nights alone on my couch, scrolling and hoping for connection and washing down hope with a handful of IPAs instead. I’m ashamed to be lonely, ashamed to ask for friends in the first place. Needing someone? How _embarrassing_.

> For men like me, spin is hard. Not just the workout, but the vulnerability: letting go of competition and leaning into the group, a dying of self so the room can revive. It requires a purging of entire realms of my shitty male points of view, from shaming self-talk to the latent homophobia I encounter within myself when the instructor tells us to dance, to “make it cute.”
> 
> …
> 
> On the way out of class the other day, I stop and hover on the outskirts of a conversation. _Great playlist!_ and _That sure was a sweaty one, huh?_ Somebody mentions heading to a taco spot. I’m orbiting on the fringes of the group, neither invited nor not invited. I know these people, kind of—Karson and Rileigh and Steven and Kaitlyn. We chat until the group dissolves, and I say my farewells. Halfway home, the clarity pierces me: _Invite yourself. Go._ I want to say I don’t know what got into me, but I do know: I want friends. Walking into the restaurant, I feel like a kid again, approaching the cool table at lunch. I’m nervous, but tenuously confident—it’s almost as if showing up and flinging my body and practicing the act of being welcomed in spin class has prepared me for this.

> From across the dining room I can see them, laughing, hands reaching for chips like communion. When I walk up, there’s an empty seat. They saved it for me. I’ve been welcome all along.

[Your Boyfriend Isn't Your Camera Man](https://www.afterbabel.com/p/your-boyfriend-isnt-your-camera-man)

> Of course, there’s nothing wrong with your partner taking occasional photos of you. I can see how it might make people feel more connected to each other’s lives. But I think there is something wrong, there is something worth talking about, with this _compulsion_ to get pictures. There’s something wrong with a compulsion that can ruin the moment; with judging every experience in terms of _likes,_ leaving it joyless, and with _demanding_ your partner document you, over and over. Of course, we don’t all behave this way, but many—_more and more of us—_do. Not just girlfriends either—friends demand it of friends; family members demand it of each other; it’s happening all the time.

####  Summary of "What do therapists do with problems they can't solve? Convert them into ones they can" by Josh Zlatkus

[What do therapists do with problems they can't solve?](https://thelivingfossils.substack.com/p/what-do-therapists-do-with-problems)

Every time I read Living Fossils, my personal convictions around whether therapy will help (or probably, will help _me_) reduce further and further.

- **Introduction**:
    - Therapy and psychology often convert unsolvable problems into ones they can address.
    - This is a common practice in institutions, described by Joan Didion as “perpetuating the department.”
- **Types of Problems Therapy Struggles With**:
    1. **Simple Problems**:
        - Therapists complicate simple issues by suggesting hidden, deeper causes (e.g., repressed emotions), avoiding obvious explanations.
    2. **Environmental Problems**:
        - Since therapists only have access to the client, they often place the responsibility for external issues (e.g., abusive relationships) on the client, even when the problem lies elsewhere.
    3. **Exceptional Problems**:
        - Rare or unique problems are often generalized to create therapeutic value, even if the situation is unlikely to repeat.
    4. **Unknowable/Complex Problems**:
        - Therapists feel pressured to provide answers, often leading to speculative or untestable explanations. The DSM is cited as an example of this need for definitive answers.
- **The Problem with Solutions**:
    - Once solutions exist, they create a gravitational pull, turning non-issues into problems (e.g., IVF or mental health questionnaires sparking new concerns).
    - The mental health industry sometimes generates problems through its array of solutions, changing how people perceive normal challenges.
- **Therapy's Conversion of Problems**:
    - Therapy tends to reshape problems into forms that are solvable or meaningful, even when a simpler explanation or solution exists.
    - This can have both positive and negative consequences: providing comfort but potentially misguiding clients.
- **Closing Thoughts**:
    - Therapy often provides noble reasons for suffering, making it easier for clients to endure difficulties until change is possible.
    - There is a placebo-like effect in therapy's narrative-building, even if the explanations aren’t fully accurate.

#### Actionable Takeaways:

1. **Iterate with Purpose**: Keep refining prompts, paying attention to how the model reacts to different phrasing. Iteration is key to prompt engineering.
    
2. **Leverage the Model’s Knowledge**: Don't be afraid to give the model complex inputs or detailed context. Today's models can handle much more than in the past.
    
3. **Test for Edge Cases**: Always consider how your prompt might fail, especially in less common scenarios, and try those cases to ensure robustness.
    
4. **Use AI to Help with Prompts**: Consider using AI models to help generate or refine prompts, making the process more efficient.

#### Google API Auth Dance

Here are the steps so that I don't forget later.

For a regular bearer token style API key, this might be sufficient:
```go
ctx := context.Background() apiKey := "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" service, err := youtube.NewService(ctx, option.WithAPIKey(apiKey))
```

For APIs that only support OAuth creds- first create OAuth cred and download client_credentials.json from the Google Developer Console

This go code below reads from the file and then generates a link to authenticate and download a token. The token can be copied from the URL bar once auth is complete

```go
func getClient(config *oauth2.Config) *http.Client {
	tokFile := "token.json"
	tok, err := tokenFromFile(tokFile)
	if err != nil {
		tok = getTokenFromWeb(config)
		saveToken(tokFile, tok)
	}
	return config.Client(context.Background(), tok)
}

func getTokenFromWeb(config *oauth2.Config) *oauth2.Token {
	authURL := config.AuthCodeURL("state-token", oauth2.AccessTypeOffline)
	fmt.Printf("Go to the following link in your browser then type the "+
		"authorization code: \n%v\n", authURL)

	var authCode string
	if _, err := fmt.Scan(&authCode); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Unable to read authorization code: %v", err)
	}

	tok, err := config.Exchange(context.TODO(), authCode)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Unable to retrieve token from web: %v", err)
	}
	return tok
}

func tokenFromFile(file string) (*oauth2.Token, error) {
	f, err := os.Open(file)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	defer f.Close()
	tok := &oauth2.Token{}
	err = json.NewDecoder(f).Decode(tok)
	return tok, err
}

func saveToken(path string, token *oauth2.Token) {
	fmt.Printf("Saving credential file to: %s\n", path)
	f, err := os.OpenFile(path, os.O_RDWR|os.O_CREATE|os.O_TRUNC, 0600)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Unable to cache oauth token: %v", err)
	}
	defer f.Close()
	json.NewEncoder(f).Encode(token)
}

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	b, err := ioutil.ReadFile("client_secret.json")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Unable to read client secret file: %v", err)
	}

	config, err := google.ConfigFromJSON(b, youtube.YoutubeForceSslScope)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Unable to parse client secret file to config: %v", err)
	}
	client := getClient(config)

    // … rest of the code
}
```

#### youtube-transcript-api

[GitHub - jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api: This is a python API which allows you to get the transcript/subtitles for a given YouTube video. It also works for automatically generated subtitles and it does not require an API key nor a headless browser, like other selenium based solutions do!](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api)

Went down the rabbit hole of how YouTube transcripts are downloaded. I need to modify [ytt](https://github.com/deepakjois/ytt) to handle requests as in this library.
