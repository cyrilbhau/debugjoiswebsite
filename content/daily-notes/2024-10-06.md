> These shifts matter because software talent is greatly treasured. Salaries are high (see chart 2). The median wage of a developer in America sits in the top 5% of all occupations, meaning that coders can earn more than nuclear engineers. Technology giants need them to make their platforms more attractive; non-tech company bosses want ever more coders to aid the digitisation efforts that, they hope, will improve productivity and increase the appeal of their products to consumers. The future looks to be one with more, and more productive, coders—and cheaper software.

[Workouts for the face are a growing business](https://www.economist.com/business/2024/10/03/workouts-for-the-face-are-a-growing-business) #face #skincare 

> The FaceGym studio in central London looks more like a hair salon than a fitness studio. Customers recline on chairs while staff pummel their faces with squishy balls. They use their knuckles to “warm up” skin and muscles; give it a “cardio” session to improve circulation; and then a deep-tissue massage. Customers, who spend at least £100 ($133), say they leave with less puffy cheeks and more defined jaw lines.
> 
> The booming market for facial workouts offers the hope of looking younger and more chiselled. A third of Britons who had a non-invasive facial treatment in 2023 had or were interested in having a face workout, says Mintel, a research firm. Their growing popularity may be a result of customers frowning at conventional facials, which involve lathering with lotions and invasive cosmetic procedures. Inge Theron, Facegym’s founder, got into facial workouts after a having “thread lift”, which uses temporary sutures, that went wrong.

[The house-price supercycle is just getting going](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/10/01/the-house-price-supercycle-is-just-getting-going) #housing #finance 

_Three factors will ensure that, for decades to come, the housing supercycle endures._: demography, allure of cities, inability to build infrastructure to bridge long distances

> Over the coming years housing markets could face all sorts of slings and arrows, from swings in economic growth and interest rates to banking busts. But with the long-term effects of demography, urban economics and infrastructure aligning, consider a prediction made in 2017 by Messrs Miles and Sefton. It finds that “in many countries it is plausible that house prices could now persistently rise faster than incomes”. The world’s biggest asset class is likely to get ever bigger.

[AI offers an intriguing new way to diagnose mental-health conditions](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2024/10/02/ai-offers-an-intriguing-new-way-to-diagnose-mental-health-conditions) #ai #therapy #mentalhealth 

> Traditional methods of diagnosing mental-health conditions require patients to speak directly to a psychiatrist. Sensible in theory, such assessments can, in practice, take months to schedule and ultimately lead to subjective diagnoses.
> 
> That is why scientists are experimenting with ways to automate this process. [Artificial-intelligence (AI)](https://www.economist.com/topics/artificial-intelligence) tools trained to listen to patients have proved capable of detecting a range of mental-health conditions, from anxiety to depression, with accuracy rates exceeding conventional diagnostic methods.
> 
> By analysing the acoustic properties of speech, these AI models can identify markers of depression or anxiety that a patient might not even be aware of, let alone able to articulate. Though individual features like pitch, tone and rhythm each play a role, the true power of these models lies in their ability to discern patterns imperceptible to a psychiatrist’s ears.
