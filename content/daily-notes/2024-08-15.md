Started the day off with a couple of pop culture podcasts:
* Taylor Lorenz: [Can Elon and Twitter save Trump? + Kamala plays with fire online | Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/power-user-with/can-elon-and-twitter-save-G5uLpsNBk_6/)
* [#MemeingTheNews - Never Post (podcast) | Listen Notes](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/never-post/memeingthenews-KrmbfS-I32z/)

TIL - Python fractions:
```python
>>> from fractions import Fraction as F
>>> F(1, 10) + F(1, 10) + F(1, 10) == F(3, 10)
True
```
