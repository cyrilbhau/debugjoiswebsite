Tough norms about sex are not random. Marriage is not random. And not only patriarchal practices are not random, but even the existence of the patriarchy is not random. Instead, there are six factors, four ecological and two social, that together determine the rules about women and men. The key to this book is the idea that there are reasons why we live in a matriarchy, a patriarchy, or a gender-equal society. Six reasons.

>  These examples above each stand for one of the six factors. In more scientific terms, they are the four ecological factors: (1) the distribution of the resources, (2) the stability of the resources, (3) the scarcity of the resources, and (4) the exploitability of the resources, together with the two societal factors: (5) the societyâ€™s technology set it uses the access the resources, and (6) the populationâ€™s fertility. Among these six factors, no single one drives gender rules and norms. It is the interaction of the six factors that matters. It is together that they determine the way societies regulate and guide the relationship between women and men.
