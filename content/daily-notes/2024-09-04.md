[How pour-over coffee got good - Works in Progress](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/how-pour-over-coffee-got-good/) - This is a really long article, and it's not just about the pourover. A lot of the article is a deep-dive into coffee culture, before it actually gets to the pourover.

One chapter of [Gendered Species: A Natural History of Patriarchy 1, David-Barrett, Tamas - Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Gendered-Species-Natural-History-Patriarchy-ebook/dp/B0D7TR9WPW) #books 

>  The core idea behind this book is that the relationship between women and men is not random. Gender rules are not random. Patriarchal institutions are not random. Tough norms about sex are not random. Marriage is not random. And not only patriarchal practices are not random, but even the existence of the patriarchy is not random. Instead, there are six factors, four ecological and two social, that together determine the rules about women and men. The key to this book is the idea that there are reasons why we live in a matriarchy, a patriarchy, or a gender-equal society. Six reasons.
>  â€¦
>  These examples above each stand for one of the six factors. In more scientific terms, they are the four ecological factors: (1) the distribution of the resources, (2) the stability of the resources, (3) the scarcity of the resources, and (4) the exploitability of the resources, together with the two societal factors: (5) the societyâ€™s technology set it uses the access the resources, and (6) the populationâ€™s fertility. Among these six factors, no single one drives gender rules and norms. It is the interaction of the six factors that matters. It is together that they determine the way societies regulate and guide the relationship between women and men.

[The hunter-gatherers of the 21st century who live on the move | Aeon Essays](https://aeon.co/essays/the-hunter-gatherers-of-the-21st-century-who-live-on-the-move)
> Key cultural and evolutionary contributions of non-sedentary humans throughout history:
> 
> - **Social Network Expansion**: Non-sedentary, mobile hunter-gatherers developed large, complex social networks across vast territories. This movement facilitated exchanges of knowledge, culture, and resources, helping to maintain genetic diversity and cultural richness even when population sizes were small.
>     
> - **Cultural Innovation and Transmission**: Mobility allowed hunter-gatherers to interact with diverse groups, fostering innovation and rapid accumulation of complex cultural practices. With exposure to numerous role models and communities, they had more opportunities to learn and build upon new ideas, technologies, and skills.
>     
> - **Genetic Diversity**: Mobility helped prevent inbreeding, especially in small populations. By traveling to find spouses from different communities, hunter-gatherers maintained genetic diversity, which was crucial for the long-term survival of human groups, especially during times of environmental stress.
>     
> - **Adaptive Strategies**: Non-sedentary humans experimented with seasonal farming, combining agriculture with foraging without fully settling. This flexible approach enabled them to adapt to changing environmental conditions without losing the advantages of mobility.
>     
> - **Cultural Preservation and Sharing**: Mobile societies, like the Mbendjele BaYaka, continued practicing rituals, sharing knowledge, and maintaining egalitarian social structures. Their nomadic lifestyle allowed them to preserve cultural traditions over long distances and generations, such as forest spirit rituals and ecological knowledge.
>     
> - **Free Time and Knowledge Transfer**: Mobile hunter-gatherer societies often enjoyed more leisure time than sedentary agricultural ones, allowing them to focus on storytelling, crafting, ritual practices, and the transmission of survival skills and cultural knowledge across generations.
>     
> - **Environmental Adaptation**: Hunter-gatherers were highly adaptable to their environments, employing sustainable practices such as rotating camps to avoid resource depletion. Their way of life demonstrated an understanding of ecological balance and resource management.
>     
> - **Influence on Human Evolution**: Movement and social interaction among different groups likely played a role in the evolutionary development of human cognition, cooperation, and innovation. The need to navigate complex social landscapes and environments may have driven the development of higher-order cognitive abilities.
