[How much ambition is too much? With Lucy Kellaway](https://www.ft.com/content/b94ba6e6-9a51-4c08-9ae1-1df189e9f0e8) #podcast

> I went along in that sort of classically quite driven way, being a columnist on the FT for decades and decades. And then somewhere in my 50s, it kind of stopped working for me a bit, I think. And I sort of thought, is this all there is? and so I quit the FT to become a school teacher, which is something that isn't really associated with ambition at all in that traditional way. But reflecting on it now, I think actually ambition is wanting something badly. Isn't that what it is? Wanting to achieve something. And maybe what I wanted had changed, but the ambition was sort of still there. It was just to do something a bit different.

Binge watched [MILF of Norway (TV Series 2024â€“ ) - IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt32424747/) . It's a  decent (albeit slow-paced at times) relationship drama exploring themes like midlife crisis and teenage angst, but what I really liked was how it normalises the idea of being an adult content creator #tv
