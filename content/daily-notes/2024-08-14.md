[How much ambition is too much? With Lucy Kellaway](https://www.ft.com/content/b94ba6e6-9a51-4c08-9ae1-1df189e9f0e8)

> I went along in that sort of classically quite driven way, being a columnist on the FT for decades and decades. And then somewhere in my 50s, it kind of stopped working for me a bit, I think. And I sort of thought, is this all there is? and so I quit the FT to become a school teacher, which is something that isn't really associated with ambition at all in that traditional way. But reflecting on it now, I think actually ambition is wanting something badly. Isn't that what it is? Wanting to achieve something. And maybe what I wanted had changed, but the ambition was sort of still there. It was just to do something a bit different.
