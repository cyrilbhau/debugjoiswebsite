* Starts with a nice overview of the recent history of AI/ML, and then makes some good points about how the field is more than just the generative stuff:  [AI is more than GenAI - Practical AI](https://lnns.co/KiBaNEcd6b1)  #ai 
* [The Americans Are Coming for London's Pricey Homes - In the City](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/in-the-city/the-americans-are-coming-for-cj5X3dVhrtD/)

Pachinko S02E03

English Teacher S01E01 and S01E02 - It's one of those shows that is really really funny, but also quite sophisticated in its humor. Loved it!

Playing around with different configuration options with `dashboard-nvim`: [GitHub - nvimdev/dashboard-nvim: vim dashboard](https://github.com/nvimdev/dashboard-nvim)

fzf-lua seems to be a better version of fzf-vim: [GitHub - ibhagwan/fzf-lua: Improved fzf.vim written in lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua) #neovim #fzf

What I really liked was that I provided a way to run the plugin in a sandboxed environment:

```
sh -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua/main/scripts/mini.sh)"
```


Skimmed the video of this podcast. Would love to get my hands on the speedrunning ideation prompt that was displayed partially (at the 4m mark). #claude #ai #prompting
