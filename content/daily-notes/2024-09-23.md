[How streaming LLM APIs work | Simon Willison’s TILs](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/streaming-llm-apis)

> The following `curl` incantation runs a prompt through GPT-4o Mini and requests a streaming respones. The `"stream_options": {"include_usage": true}` bit requests that the final message in the stream include details of how many input and output tokens were charged while processing the prompt.
> 
> ```shell
> curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
>   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
>   -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
>   -d '{
>     "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
>     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}],
>     "stream": true,
>     "stream_options": {
>       "include_usage": true
>     }
>   }' \
>   --no-buffer
> ```
> 
> That `--no-buffer` option ensures `curl` outputs the stream to the console as it arrives.

[Opinion | Helicopter Parents Should Ignore Their Children More Often - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/opinion/parenting-helicopter-ignoring.html/) #parenthood 

> I recently spoke with an anthropologist named Barry Hewlett who studies child-rearing in hunter-gatherer societies in Central Africa. He explained to me that children in those societies spend lots of time with their parents — they tag along throughout the day and often help with tasks like foraging — but they are rarely the main object of their parents’ attention. Sometimes bored, sometimes engaged, these kids spend much of their time observing adults doing adult things.

[The mystery of Masayoshi Son, SoftBank’s great disrupter](https://on.ft.com/4dgHxYJ) - Great profile in the FT

There is an interesting connection between Son and the show I have been watching recently - _Pachinko_. Turns out Masa was a son Korean immigrants, and his dad ran a Pachinko parlor.

> Masayoshi Son is a quintessential outsider. This may explain his bottomless risk appetite and his desire to prove himself, over and over again. He was born in 1957 to poverty-stricken second-generation Korean immigrants on the island of Kyushu in the western Japanese archipelago. The family home was the equivalent of a cowshed, one of dozens of makeshift dwellings on a plot of unregistered land near the railway station. 
> 
> Years later, Son confessed to a friend that he suffered from a recurring dream, waking up to the stench of pig faeces in his nostrils. His friend told him it wasn’t a nightmare but a childhood memory. “We started at the bottom of society,” Son told me. “I didn’t even know what nationality I was.” 
> 
> As Korean-Japanese, the Son family followed tradition and lived under a Japanese name, Yasumoto. (Son later persuaded the authorities to let him combine his Japanese first name and Korean surname — a notable breakthrough.) His father Mitsunori was a bootlegger at the age of 14, later diversifying into pig breeding, loan sharking and pachinko, a form of low-stakes gambling that offered a livelihood to Koreans shut out of the Japanese economy.

#### Articles about o1 "Strawberry" models from OpenAI
[Something New: On OpenAI's "Strawberry" and Reasoning](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/something-new-on-openais-strawberry)

> The new AI model, called o1-preview (why are the AI companies so bad at names?), lets the AI “think through” a problem before solving it. This lets it address very hard problems that require planning and iteration, like novel math or science questions. In fact, it can now beat human PhD experts in solving extremely hard physics problems.
> 
> To be clear, o1-preview doesn’t do everything better. It is not a better writer than GPT-4o, for example. But for tasks that require planning, the changes are quite large.
> 
> …
> 
> Using o1-preview means confronting a paradigm change in AI. Planning is a form of agency, where the AI arrives at conclusions about how to solve a problem on its own, without our help. You can see from the video above that the AI does so much thinking and heavy lifting, churning out complete results, that my role as a human partner feels diminished. It just does its thing and hands me an answer. Sure, I can sift through its pages of reasoning to spot mistakes, but I no longer feel as connected to the AI output, or that I am playing as large a role in shaping where the solution is going. This isn’t necessarily bad, but it is different.

[OpenAI just unleashed an alien of extraordinary ability](https://www.understandingai.org/p/openai-just-unleashed-an-alien-of)

> The key to OpenAI’s breakthrough is a training technique called reinforcement learning, which helped the o1 models to reason in a more focused and precise way. In this article I’ll first briefly explain OpenAI’s approach, and then I’ll give some examples of difficult problems the o1 models can solve—and a few they still can’t.

The whole [section on reinforcement learning](https://www.understandingai.org/i/149152572/the-trouble-with-imitation-learning) is worth reading.

> The Mr Beast memo is really important because it’s the first look at how a Gen Z leader operates. And he operates in the confines of a platforms - with all the same drive and passion of Bezos and Jobs, but is skewed toward metrics versus meaning. Controversy is swirling around him - but he has an algorithm to appease.
