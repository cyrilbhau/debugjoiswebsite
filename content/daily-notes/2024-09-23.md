> ```shell
> curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
>   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
>   -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
>   -d '{
>     "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
>     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}],
>     "stream": true,
>     "stream_options": {
>       "include_usage": true
>     }
>   }' \
>   --no-buffer
> ```
> 
> That `--no-buffer` option ensures `curl` outptus the stream to the console as it arrives.
