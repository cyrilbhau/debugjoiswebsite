[How streaming LLM APIs work | Simon Willison’s TILs](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/streaming-llm-apis)

> The following `curl` incantation runs a prompt through GPT-4o Mini and requests a streaming respones. The `"stream_options": {"include_usage": true}` bit requests that the final message in the stream include details of how many input and output tokens were charged while processing the prompt.
> 
> ```shell
> curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
>   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
>   -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
>   -d '{
>     "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
>     "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Tell me a joke"}],
>     "stream": true,
>     "stream_options": {
>       "include_usage": true
>     }
>   }' \
>   --no-buffer
> ```
> 
> That `--no-buffer` option ensures `curl` outputs the stream to the console as it arrives.

[Opinion | Helicopter Parents Should Ignore Their Children More Often - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/15/opinion/parenting-helicopter-ignoring.html/) #parenthood 

> I recently spoke with an anthropologist named Barry Hewlett who studies child-rearing in hunter-gatherer societies in Central Africa. He explained to me that children in those societies spend lots of time with their parents — they tag along throughout the day and often help with tasks like foraging — but they are rarely the main object of their parents’ attention. Sometimes bored, sometimes engaged, these kids spend much of their time observing adults doing adult things.
