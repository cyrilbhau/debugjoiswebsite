[The 'Biggest Man-Made Disaster' Ever? - by kyla scanlon](https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-biggest-man-made-disaster-ever)

> For the first time since 1977, the International Longshoremen’s Association (ILA) went on strike. ~45,000 dockworkers have started picketing at 36 US East and Gulf ports - from Houston to Miami to New Jersey. This comes at a _very_ intense time with escalating geopolitical tensions, a presidential election in about a month, and a hurricane that devastated the lives of millions of people.
>
> This strike represents about half of all US trade volumes. It puts $2 billion at risk per day in trade, and the economic loss could be as high as $5 billion a [day](https://nam.org/news-insights/). A strike that lasts only a week could take a month to clear. Some might say that’s mere pennies compared to the size of the US economy ($29T), but this is about more than just dollar signs.
> 
> Because strike is about more than just money- it’s about the democracy of automation.

Kyla Scanlon, as always with yet another great analysis - this time on the longshoremen strike.
