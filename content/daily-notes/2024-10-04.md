[The 'Biggest Man-Made Disaster' Ever? - by kyla scanlon](https://kyla.substack.com/p/the-biggest-man-made-disaster-ever)

> For the first time since 1977, the International Longshoremen‚Äôs Association (ILA) went on strike. ~45,000 dockworkers have started picketing at 36 US East and Gulf ports - from Houston to Miami to New Jersey. This comes at a¬†_very_¬†intense time with escalating geopolitical tensions, a presidential election in about a month, and a hurricane that devastated the lives of millions of people.
>
> This strike represents about half of all US trade volumes. It puts $2 billion at risk per day in trade, and the economic loss could be as high as $5 billion a¬†[day](https://nam.org/news-insights/). A strike that lasts only a week could take a month to clear. Some might say that‚Äôs mere pennies compared to the size of the US economy ($29T), but this is about more than just dollar signs.
> 
> Because strike is about more than just money- it‚Äôs about the democracy of automation.

Kyla Scanlon, as always with yet another great analysis - this time on the longshoremen strike.

[Are mental health awareness efforts contributing to the rise in reported mental health problems? A call to test the prevalence inflation hypothesis - ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732118X2300003X) #mentalhealth 

> In the past decade, there have been extensive efforts in the Western world to raise public awareness about¬†[mental health](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/psychology/mental-health "Learn more about mental health from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")¬†problems, with the goal of reducing or preventing these symptoms across the population. Despite these efforts, reported rates of mental health problems have increased in these countries over the same period. In this paper, we present the hypothesis that, paradoxically, awareness efforts are contributing to this reported increase in mental health problems. We term this the¬†_prevalence inflation hypothesis._¬†First, we argue that mental health awareness efforts are leading to more accurate reporting of previously under-recognised symptoms, a beneficial outcome. Second, and more problematically, we propose that awareness efforts are leading some individuals to interpret and report milder forms of distress as mental health problems. We propose that this then leads some individuals to experience a genuine increase in symptoms, because labelling distress as a mental health problem can affect an individual's self-concept and behaviour in a way that is ultimately self-fulfilling. For example, interpreting low levels of anxiety as symptomatic of an anxiety disorder might lead to behavioural avoidance, which can further exacerbate anxiety symptoms. We propose that the increase in reported symptoms then drives further awareness efforts: the two processes influence each other in a cyclical, intensifying manner. We end by suggesting ways to test this hypothesis and argue that future awareness efforts need to mitigate the issues we present.

> It‚Äôs easy to dismiss Miku and WaifuChat as a niche product for lonely, introverted men who are already somewhat on the fringes of society, disconnected from real-life relationships as it is. But that‚Äôs not looking at where the puck‚Äôs going: It‚Äôs not just Dungeons & Dragons‚Äìplaying ‚Äúincels‚Äù who are susceptible to the allure of AI-powered connections, at least not for long. Like a lot of other virtual-world trends, what starts out as a niche can quickly become mainstream. And by the way, those introverted ‚Äúnerds‚Äù who spend loads of time alone on their devices? They‚Äôre a growing percentage of the population.
