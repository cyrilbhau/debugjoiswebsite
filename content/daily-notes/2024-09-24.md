The NYT has a cute tribute to the classic Fjällräven Kånken backpack: [The Classic Fjällräven Kånken Backpack Is Flawed. I Love It Anyway. | Reviews by Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/classic-fjallraven-kanken-backpack/) #backpack #travel

> Imperfect, yes. And yet: Day after day, week after week, year after year, I step out of the house, the city, the state, the country. I change time zones, I change jobs. I go shopping, I go sightseeing, I go to the park, I take a hike, I hop on a bike. I get stronger, I get weaker, I get older, my back disappoints me again. I have a mountain of bags to choose from—chic leather totes and crossbody bags flush with pockets and amply padded backpacks—but if I’m going out for more than two hours and up to a day, I don’t blink an eye. I choose this, my flawed little dream of a backpack.
