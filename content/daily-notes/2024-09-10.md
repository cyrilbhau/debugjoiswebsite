[Childless - by Satya Doyle Byock - Self & Society](https://satyadoylebyock.substack.com/p/childless-lisa-marchiano-mind-your-own-damn-business)

> The truth is that I’ve bit my tongue about Lisa Marchiano’s work for years, just as I have about Jordan Peterson’s, two people who use their platforms to equate “archetypal” and stereotypical perspectives of gender with psychology. I’ve bit my tongue because I’m not seeking a public fight. But there’s no doubt that much of their work is causing harm. Their anti-trans rhetoric and regressive ideas about women and men, and the masculine and feminine, are genuinely dangerous, drawing on people’s worst hunches and instincts, not the forward movement of psychic life. It’s hard to watch Jung’s work being used in such damaging ways; not for the sake of _liberating_ _people_ to live their individual lives as intended, but to reinforce the prisons of sex and gender as defined by others, equating genitalia with one’s psychological life just as eugenicists have, for centuries, equated skin color with intelligence.

> Childless women have always existed. Just as trans people have always existed. The increased awareness of these populations today is not a result of social epidemics or wrong-headedness. Nor are the books and support groups around to attract people to a new “lifestyle choice.” No, the visibility is increasing because those who have historically lived with shame and grief outside of the standard white, colonial, hetero-normative, Christian images of “man” and “woman” are advocating for themselves, creating communities, and living less and less in the shadows.
>
> In an era when gender apartheid is on the rise worldwide and gender-nonconforming people of all stripes are fighting for their lives, anyone with a platform would do well to resist fueling right-wing rhetoric with biological essentialist arguments and outdated notions of sex and individuation. Simplistic ideas about how men and women “should be” carry real-world power, cause disorientation and self-doubt, and ultimately threaten lives. This is true for cis men as much as cis women, as it is for non-binary and trans people. Biology is not archetypal. Motherhood is not for everyone. Sex is not destiny.

[Language Log » Berber, emic vs. etic](https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=65864)

> When my Uber driver told me last Sunday in Philadelphia that he was a Berber, I told him that he must be proud of his heritage, he responded, "Actually, we don't like that name.  It was imposed on us by Arabs, and it means the same thing as 'barbarian'.  We prefer to call ourselves 'Amazigh'."

[Isaiah Berlin on Pluralism](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~vl/notes/berlin.html?ueid=7aaabf0d71933f976c55b0f4b1bd9f88)

> That is why pluralism is not relativism -- the multiple values are objective, part of the essence of humanity rather than arbitrary creations of men's subjective fancies. Nevertheless, of course, if I pursue one set of values I may detest another, and may think it is damaging to the only form of life that I am able to live or tolerate, for myself and others; in which case I may attack it, I may even -- in extreme cases -- have to go to war against it. But I still recognize it as a human pursuit. I find Nazi values detestable, but I can understand how, given enough misinformation, enough false belief about reality, one could come to believe that they are the only salvation. Of course they have to be fought, by war if need be, but I do not regard the Nazis, as some people do, as literally pathological or insane, only as wickedly wrong, totally misguided about the facts, for example in believing that some beings are subhuman, or that race is central, or that Nordic races alone are truly creative, and so forth. I see how, with enough false education, enough widespread illusion and error, men can, while remaining men, believe this and commit the most unspeakable crimes.


[Why do we do things that are bad for us? The ancient philosophers had an answer | Well actually | The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/wellness/2024/mar/21/why-we-do-things-bad-for-us-impulse-habits-akrasia)

> To achieve your goals, it can be more effective to put into place a defined plan that doesn’t let you reconsider. The psychologist Peter Gollwitzer called this an implementation intention: come up with a specific if/then statement that helps you achieve your goal. If it’s Tuesday, then I will go to yoga class; if I buy spinach, then I will make this smoothie for breakfast the next morning.
> 
> Kalis added that changing your environment might be a better way to resist akrasia than trying to improve your willpower. These changes are called commitment devices: they don’t allow you to change your mind. As an extreme example, when Victor Hugo wrote The Hunchback of Notre Dame, he told his assistant to lock away all of his clothes so that he was [forced](https://jamesclear.com/akrasia) to stay inside and write.

[Words on Founder Mode – Rands in Repose](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/words-on-founder-mode/)

> Graham hints at some of the attributes of Founder Mode but mostly says it’s not a well-defined. It is. Founder Mode is the culture of a company and a culture is defined by the character of the founders. Here are the values I’ve discovered over and over again working with these humans:
> 
> - The whole team is involved in the details. Anyone can argue about the product because everyone works to be a product expert.
> - Everyone does the work. The stratification of responsibility is a red flag not just in rapidly growing team, but any company. Everyone files bugs because everyone uses the product. Yes, there is job specialization, but there is also a belief that we are equally accountable for the product.
> - An organization chart doesn’t tell you who can speak with whom; it tells you who is accountable for what. It’s a map. Not a power structure.
> 
> And finally, hire leaders, not managers.

Need to go buy this book now. Looks amazing: [An American Affordable Housing Crisis, Built By Local Democracy - Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-08/an-american-affordable-housing-crisis-built-by-local-democracy)

> [_On The Housing Crisis: Land, Development, Democracy_](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/09/jerusalem-demsas-on-the-housing-crisis-book/679666/) is a collection of reported essays by Demsas that explores the role that democratic structures play in perpetuating a housing shortage. Writing with plain yet authoritative language, she tackles the difference between such thorny economic concepts as [shortage denialism and supply skepticism](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/us-housing-supply-shortage-crisis-2022/672240/), showing how they manifest in real communities. Yet she also writes from the ground level to explore the toll of hyperlocal overdemocracy, connecting rational decisions by neighborhoods to reject development to an irrational picture of a country that can no longer build.
> 
> “Americans are aware by now that the housing affordability crisis is acute, but many don’t understand what’s causing it,” Demsas writes in the introduction to her new book. “All too often, explanations center around identifying a villain: greedy developers, or private equity companies, or racist neighbors, or gentrifiers, or corrupt politicians. These stories are not always false, nor are these villains imaginary, but they don’t speak to root causes.”
