* [Your Fall Prime-time TV Grid and 'Industry' S3E5](https://lnns.co/pLJozA9CbEQ) #tv - Some interesting recommendations. Found [Landman](https://youtu.be/7zxh49-bsIk?si=ypAcX7NQyXbJk7Da) which is coming out in Nov
* [Blush Blindness and Broccoli Perms: Decoding Teen Beauty](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/after-school/blush-blindness-and-broccoli-JmiVj4x1D3K/) - randomly started to listen to this podcast after I came across Casey Lewis' substack. Figured it wasnt a bad idea keeping up with GenZ trends 🙃


[Childless - by Satya Doyle Byock - Self & Society](https://satyadoylebyock.substack.com/p/childless-lisa-marchiano-mind-your-own-damn-business)

> The truth is that I’ve bit my tongue about Lisa Marchiano’s work for years, just as I have about Jordan Peterson’s, two people who use their platforms to equate “archetypal” and stereotypical perspectives of gender with psychology. I’ve bit my tongue because I’m not seeking a public fight. But there’s no doubt that much of their work is causing harm. Their anti-trans rhetoric and regressive ideas about women and men, and the masculine and feminine, are genuinely dangerous, drawing on people’s worst hunches and instincts, not the forward movement of psychic life. It’s hard to watch Jung’s work being used in such damaging ways; not for the sake of _liberating_ _people_ to live their individual lives as intended, but to reinforce the prisons of sex and gender as defined by others, equating genitalia with one’s psychological life just as eugenicists have, for centuries, equated skin color with intelligence.
