* [Your Fall Prime-time TV Grid and 'Industry' S3E5](https://lnns.co/pLJozA9CbEQ) #tv - Some interesting recommendations. Found [Landman](https://youtu.be/7zxh49-bsIk?si=ypAcX7NQyXbJk7Da) which is coming out in Nov
* [Blush Blindness and Broccoli Perms: Decoding Teen Beauty](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/after-school/blush-blindness-and-broccoli-JmiVj4x1D3K/) - randomly started to listen to this podcast after I came across Casey Lewis' substack. Figured it wasnt a bad idea keeping up with GenZ trends
