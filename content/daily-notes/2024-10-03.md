This tweet made me watch Annayum Rasoolum today. The movie has its weak points (long rambly plot, for one!) but the excellent cinematography and a deeply humanistic portrayal of Kochi working class folk makes up for it. Loved Andrea Jeremiah's performance.

The latest Capital Gains newsletter has great career advice: [Central Nodes](https://capitalgains.thediff.co/p/central-nodes) #tech #career 

> That offsetting growth comes from two sources that sound like they're opposites but that actually have some deep similarities. One is that as people age, they accumulate more loose social ties, and those ties are relevant to what they do. Someone who's worked in investing for a long time will have a roster of friends whose opinions they respect on specific topics, like the mechanics of ETF construction, the best way for an American to tax-optimize investments in Europe, or how to handicap the odds when one of your portfolio companies faces a big lawsuit. In other fields, the specifics of expertise vary, but the general phenomenon holds—jobs have turnover, many jobs involve working with outside organizations, so over time the number of people who you vaguely know will keep on increasing.
>
> But people also accumulate _facts_, and get better at pattern-matching. This is especially useful when an industry goes through a long cycle: in 2022, there were professional investors with a decade of tech investing experience who had literally never experienced a bear market that didn't resolve itself in a quarter or two. And, in fact, they'd experienced what looked like a literally apocalyptic bear market in 2020, and saw that the time gap between "the world is ending" and "stocks are now at a record high" was about five months. Someone a bit more experienced, who remembered either the long painful grind-down from 2000-2002, or that the low point for US equities during the financial crisis was months _after_ the spectacular headlines—the market started moving up in 2009 when the flow of bad news slowed, not so much because there was good news.

> Two actionable pieces of advice are about increasing the space of relevant connections:
> 
> 1. Do case studies a bit outside of your exact job function—if you're a software engineer, learn something about product management; if you're in equities, learn a bit about how credit people think. You won't necessarily apply this directly, but it will inform the work that you actually do (sometimes an equity investor looking at a deep value situation can save a lot of time by noticing that the company's bonds trade at 50 cents on the dollar—there's a chance that the bonds are a better risk-adjusted deal and a potential indicator that the company's problems are deeper than they look.)
>     
> 2. Similarly, try to have a network that skews a little bit away from what you work on. The more senior you get in your career, the less problems are framed as tasks. "Do X (which fixes Y)," becomes "Fix Y," with the specifics left as an exercise for the reader.
