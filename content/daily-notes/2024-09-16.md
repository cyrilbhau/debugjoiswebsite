Lots of TV #tv :
* Industry S03E06
* Pachinko S02E04
* How To Die Alone S01E01-04 - Loved this! It is a very unique and funny take on the workplace comedy genre. I haven't watched a TV show based in an airport. Every episode I learn something new and quirky about what goes on behind the scenes in a typical modern airport. Ofcourse the human drama is very relatable as well.
