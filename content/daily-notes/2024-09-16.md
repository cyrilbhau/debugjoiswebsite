Lots of TV #tv :
* Industry S03E06
* Pachinko S02E04
* How To Die Alone S01E01-04 - Loved this! It is a very unique and funny take on the workplace comedy genre. I haven't watched a TV show based in an airport. Every episode I learn something new and quirky about what goes on behind the scenes in a typical modern airport. Ofcourse the human drama is very relatable and heartwarming as well.

Podcasts #podcasts:
* [What happens when you sell education like shampoo? Byju's knows](https://lnns.co/akn1oIx-R_W) - There have been lots of pieces of Byju's demise and you could probably skip this if you have followed the coverage closely. If not, this a great, snappy overview of the history of Byju and the eventual debacle.
* [Mythbusting Bedsheets - The Wirecutter Show](https://lnns.co/QVzy1dDkMbL) - This is such a thorough overview of bedsheets that you don't need to go anywhere else. I will try to summarize the key points once I read the transcript. 
* [Industry Season 3 Episode 6 Recap - RHAP: We Know Scripted TV](https://lnns.co/IVR0fXMsHvP) - The first of my three regular recaps

#### Summary of Wirecutter Podcast on Bedsheets
Major Themes #bedsheets #wirecutter
1. **Types of Cotton Sheets**:
	- **Percale vs. Sateen**: These are the two primary weaves in cotton sheets. Percale is a lightweight, airy weave that’s crisp and often likened to hotel sheets, while sateen is a denser, silkier weave that drapes over the body, offering more warmth.
    - **Long Staple Cotton**: Jackie explains that long staple cotton fibers are preferable for durability and comfort. Look for labels indicating "long staple" or "extra-long staple" for higher quality sheets.
2. **Thread Count and Fabric Quality**:
    - **Thread Count Myth**: High thread count is often used as a marketing gimmick. The ideal range for percale sheets is 250-300, and for sateen, it’s 400-600. Anything above these ranges doesn’t necessarily translate to better quality.
    - **Cotton vs. Synthetic**: Cotton is favored for its breathability and softness. Synthetic fibers, although sometimes finer, can result in denser, less breathable sheets.
3. **Other Materials**:
    - **Linen**: Made from flax, linen is breathable but can feel scratchier than cotton. It's known for being cool and airy, making it suitable for hot sleepers.
    - **Flannel**: Flannel sheets are brushed cotton that traps heat, making them ideal for winter use. However, they tend to pill over time.
4. **Label Reading and Certifications**:
    - Look for terms like "100% cotton," "long staple," "Pima," "Supima," or "Giza" on labels for quality assurance.
    - **Oeko-Tex Certification**: Indicates that the sheets have been tested for harmful substances and are safe for direct skin contact.
5. **Marketing Myths**:
    - **Egyptian Cotton**: Not all Egyptian cotton is high quality. The label simply indicates the origin, not the quality of the fiber.
    - **Cooling Sheets**: Claims about sheets being "cooling" are often marketing ploys. Actual breathability depends on the weave and material.

In the podcast, Jackie Reeve mentions "swoveralls" during the final question about the last thing she bought that she absolutely loved. [Swoveralls](https://swoveralls.com/) are overalls made out of sweatpant material. 

#### Some critical takes on Founder Mode

[Founder Mode, hackers, and being bored by tech | Ian Betteridge](https://ianbetteridge.com/2024/09/14/founder-mode-hackers-and-being-bored-by-tech/)

> Tech has become all Jobs and no Woz.

[Paul Graham and the Cult of the Founder - by Dave Karpf](https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/paul-graham-and-the-cult-of-the-founder?r=eeyg&triedRedirect=true)

> "Founder Mode" is such garbage.

> It occurs to me that Aaron and Altman represent two archetypes of what Silicon Valley might value. Sam Altman embodied the ideals of the founder. He so impressed Paul Graham that, even though Altman’s company (Loopt) was a failure, Graham named him the the next President of YCombinator. Say what you will about the guy, but he has a remarkable flair for failing upward.
> 
> Aaron, meanwhile, was a hacker [in the classical sense of the word](https://www.stevenlevy.com/hackers-heroes-of-the-computer-revolution). He was intensely curious, brilliant, and generous. He was kind, yet uncompromising. He had a temper, but he pretty much only directed it toward idiots in positions of power. When he saw something wrong, he would build his own solution.

> This is all of a piece with Andreessen’s [techno-optimist manifesto](https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/why-cant-our-tech-billionaires-learn) and Balaji Srinivasan’s [batshit bitcoin declarations](https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/not-enough-people-are-making-fun). A small, cloistered elite of not-especially-bright billionaires have decided that they are _very, very special_, and that the problem with society these days is that people keep treating them like everyone else.

#### /etc/synthetic.conf on OS X

Found out about it in Siver's post: [How to sync Mac and Linux /home | Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs/macx) #osx #files 

The `synthetic.conf` file on macOS (OS X) allows system administrators to create "synthetic" file system objects (files, directories, or symlinks) that appear to exist at the specified paths, but are actually stored elsewhere on the system.

For e.g. - let's say you're a developer working on multiple projects, and you want to organize your work in a specific way without changing the actual file locations. You could use `synthetic.conf` to create a virtual project structure.

```txt
# Virtual project structure Projects/WebApp
/Users/developer/work/client_a/webapp Projects/MobileApp
/Users/developer/work/client_b/mobile_app Projects/API
/Users/developer/work/internal/api_project
```

- You have projects scattered in different locations on your Mac.
- The synthetic entries create a unified `/Projects` directory with all your projects, making it easier to access them.
