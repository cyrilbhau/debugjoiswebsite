Came across this substack post from somebody on X and found it super intriguing: [Good At Sex: Seduction Via Narrative Reinforcement (pt 7)](https://aella.substack.com/p/good-at-sex-seduction-via-narrative)

> I view sex as a success for _both_ of us, and thus **seduction is a collaborative activity**. We both want the same thing: to get around my annoying brain gatekeeper that got installed there by eons of evolution that doesn’t understand birth control and is trying to evaluate if you’re worthy of impregnating me. So please—use seduction techniques on me. Roleplay as an alpha male well enough to trick my vagina into believing that your cum will give me alpha sons.
