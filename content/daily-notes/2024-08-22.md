Skimmed the `fswatch` docs to better understand how events are generated: [Top (fswatch 1.17.1)](https://emcrisostomo.github.io/fswatch/doc/1.17.1/fswatch.html/) #tools 

notes on effectively fucking around and finding out: [e/fuck](https://effectivefuck.com/) #quotes 

> **side quests > main quests**
> 
> the main quests are predictable and boring, always stay contrarian and make choices based on how fucking random they'll sound when you are explaining them to your product mommy/daddy tinder date. doing this also just helps you find out about niche scenes and subcultures that you otherwise won't
> 
> **good vibes + good friends >>>> everything**
> 
> now that you are doing random things , you'll meet lots of random people, and the main goal of e/fuck is to have good vibes and make as many **actual friends as possible**. you have to actually like spending time with them, and the optimal action is always to be nice and help your friends if you can, even if you don't necessarily get anything in return
> 
> **stay himbo**
> 
> you are probably going to meet people with weird or off vibes that you don't fuck with. usually the default reaction is to be confrontational, but do you **actually care?** just listen, understand, if its not your thing, let them do what they want and don't be friends with them.
> 
> **keep fumbling**
> 
> if you keep fumbling (partners, jobs, whatever), you are definitely fucking around and finding out - otherwise how would you even get the opportunity to fumble, you know?

Someone one twitter said they hated waking up to workout, which set me off on a tangent about how much I hate working out. Pulled up a quote I had read a long time ago, about exercise. It's from an essay Against Exercise by Mark Greif.

> “Modern exercise makes you acknowledge the machine operating inside yourself. Nothing can make you believe we harbor nostalgia for factory work but a modern gym. The lever of the die press no longer commands us at work. But with the gym we import vestiges of the leftover equipment of industry to our leisure. We leave the office, and put the conveyor belt under our feet, and run as if chased by devils. We willingly submit our legs to the mangle, and put our stiffening arms to the press.”

Dug into the docs for Go templates and discovered `define` and `template` actions: [template package - text/template - Go Packages](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template#section-directories)
