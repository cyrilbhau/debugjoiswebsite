notes on effectively fucking around and finding out: [e/fuck](https://effectivefuck.com/)

**side quests > main quests**

the main quests are predictable and boring, always stay contrarian and make choices based on how fucking random they'll sound when you are explaining them to your product mommy/daddy tinder date. doing this also just helps you find out about niche scenes and subcultures that you otherwise won't

**good vibes + good friends >>>> everything**

now that you are doing random things , you'll meet lots of random people, and the main goal of e/fuck is to have good vibes and make as many **actual friends as possible**. you have to actually like spending time with them, and the optimal action is always to be nice and help your friends if you can, even if you don't necessarily get anything in return

**stay himbo**

you are probably going to meet people with weird or off vibes that you don't fuck with. usually the default reaction is to be confrontational, but do you **actually care?** just listen, understand, if its not your thing, let them do what they want and don't be friends with them.

**keep fumbling**

if you keep fumbling (partners, jobs, whatever), you are definitely fucking around and finding out - otherwise how would you even get the opportunity to fumble, you know?
