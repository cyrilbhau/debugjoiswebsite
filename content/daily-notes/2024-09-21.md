#### Installing Ubuntu 24.04 on a Dell Inspiron
 I wanted to install Ubuntu on a Dell laptop that had a factory reset Windows installation. Ran into two issues even before the installation could begin
* The first time, the Ubuntu installer complained that I needed to turn off Intel Rapid Storage technology. I found the option in the BIOS under SATA Mode and switched to AHCI, even though it's supposed to be for SATA drives (and the laptop had an SSD drive)
* After rebooting, the Ubuntu installer complained again saying I had to "turn off" Bitlocker encryption on my drives. This was even though I asked it to do a clean install.
