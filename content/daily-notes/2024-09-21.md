#### Installing Ubuntu 24.04 on a Dell Inspiron
 I wanted to install Ubuntu on a Dell laptop that had a factory reset Windows installation. Ran into two issues even before the installation could begin
* The first time, the Ubuntu installer complained that I needed to turn off Intel Rapid Storage technology. I found the option in the BIOS under SATA Mode and switched to AHCI, even though it's supposed to be for SATA drives (and the laptop had an SSD drive)
* After rebooting, the Ubuntu installer complained again saying I had to "turn off" Bitlocker encryption on my drives. This was even though I asked it to do a clean install. The workaround was to proceed with a "Manual" installation and delete all the partitions myself. It's a bit annoying and the instructions aren't very clear.

Anyway, after those steps I was able to get a clean Ubuntu installation on the laptop.

Omakub was seriously impressive. I installed it immediately after installing Ubuntu and it was a smooth process, and gave me a desktop which was nearly all the way there in terms of how I would have customised it. The Gnome tiling features have come a long way since I last used them, and I actually had a bit of FOMO.

I am gonna study [the repo](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub) and copy some of the shell customizations and utlities for my Mac setup as well.
#### Children and how our brain changes
[The sweeping reorganisation of the brain in pregnancy, and why it matters](https://www.listennotes.com/e/840771752993423492eb34a2807a471e/) #podcasts

Listening to the podcast above coincided with an NYT article I came across about "Dad brain": [Opinion | Fatherhood Transforms Men’s Brains and Bodies - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/16/opinion/dad-brain-fatherhood-parenting.html)

> My research lab investigates how the brain changes when men become fathers, and we are discovering that fatherhood can be transformative for their brains and bodies. The brain and hormonal changes we observe in new dads tell us that nature intended men to participate in child rearing, because it equipped them with neurobiological architecture to do so. They, too, can show the fundamental instinct for nurturing that’s often attributed solely to mothers.
> 
> Not only that, but men’s involvement in fatherhood can have long-term benefits for their brain health — and for healthy societies. At a time when boys and men [seem to be experiencing](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/10/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-richard-reeves.html) greater social isolation and declining occupational prospects, the role of father can provide a meaningful source of identity. But the transition to fatherhood can also be a time of vulnerability, which is why supporting fathers should be a priority for policymakers.
> 
> …
> 
>  Men also lost gray matter volume in new fatherhood, in some of the same regions that changed in women. But volume reductions for dads were less pronounced. The findings for mothers had been so striking that a machine-learning algorithm could tell mothers and nonmothers apart by their brain scans alone. The picture was noisier for fathers. My hunch is that men’s brain changes looked less clear-cut because fathers vary so much in their levels of engagement in parenting.

#### Onam
Came across this interesting piece of trivia from Nayantara Menon Bagla on Twitter

![](https://x.com/BaglaNayantara/status/1835642728513695974)

The real significance of Onam: [The Story of Maveli - Mavelinadu](https://mavelinaducollective.com/the-story-of-maveli/)

> It was a man named Sahodaran Ayyappan – a disciple of Narayana Guru, an Ezhava poet and anti-caste activist, who revived the story of Maveli in Kerala. He penned a version of the _Onapaattu_ (song of Onam) that is a critique of the brahmanism that has burgeoned in Kerala since the 8th century CE. He calls for a return to the time of Mavelinadu, before the feudal Hindu system infiltrated the land and created notions of purity and pollution.
> 
> To people belonging to marginalised castes in Kerala, especially avarna people, Mahabali remains a symbol of a past that was untainted by the disease of brahmanism. There have been a number of attempts to sanitise this story of its revolutionary importance, and to appropriate Onam into a Hindu festival, even rebrand it as “Vamana Jayanti”. This is an insult to the cultural legacy of Maveli, and we must reclaim this story, passed on to us through generations of oral tradition. We assert that Maveli is a symbol of our historical struggle against caste, and an egalitarian shramana tradition that lingers in our memory.

A 25 yr old moves to a place in the UK where the median age is 48: [I moved to a sleepy town with few people my age.

> Growing these intergenerational connections hasn’t only showed me the vast possibilities of the human experience, it has also allowed me to get out of the social media bubble of cyclical trends that is easy to get stuck in as a gen Z person. It has shown me there is more to life than the talking point of the news feed that week. As someone who has grown up online, I often make the mistake of replacing offline community with online interaction, but I’m learning that this can [never be truly fulfilling](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/article/2024/jun/12/young-people-turning-away-from-phones-social-media-addiction).
> 
> Making friends with people of different ages has also shown me that while your 20s are scary, they’re not as serious as we often make them feel. There is always time to change our mind and start again. Learning that from my community of older friends, and knowing that they are learning from me, has helped me to get some relief from the idea that my life has been on the clock since I hit 25.
