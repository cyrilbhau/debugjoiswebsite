#### Installing Ubuntu 24.04 on a Dell Inspiron
 I wanted to install Ubuntu on a Dell laptop that had a factory reset Windows installation. Ran into two issues even before the installation could begin
* The first time, the Ubuntu installer complained that I needed to turn off Intel Rapid Storage technology. I found the option in the BIOS under SATA Mode and switched to AHCI, even though it's supposed to be for SATA drives (and the laptop had an SSD drive)
* After rebooting, the Ubuntu installer complained again saying I had to "turn off" Bitlocker encryption on my drives. This was even though I asked it to do a clean install. The workaround was to proceed with a "Manual" installation and delete all the partitions myself. It's a bit annoying and the instructions aren't very clear.

Anyway, after those steps I was able to get a clean Ubuntu installation on the laptop.

Omakub was seriously impressive. I installed it immediately after installing Ubuntu and it was a smooth process, and gave me a desktop which was nearly all the way there in terms of how I would have customised it. The Gnome tiling features have come a long way since I last used them, and I actually had a bit of FOMO.

I am gonna study [the repo](https://github.com/basecamp/omakub) and copy some of the shell customizations and utlities for my Mac setup as well.
