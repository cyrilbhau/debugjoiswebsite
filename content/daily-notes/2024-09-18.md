	* [367. A Brief History of Apocalypse - This Machine Kills](https://lnns.co/v-bIRioU8lC)- This podcast uses an article in The Atlantic ([Yuval Noah Harari’s Apocalyptic Vision - The Atlantic](https://archive.ph/jU618)) to critically deconstruct Harari's writing and cult of personality. It is actually quite hard to find reviews of his books online that are written by actual anthropologists in the field. But I did find one of his book Sapiens a long time ago ([A Reductionist History of Humankind — The New Atlantis](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/a-reductionist-history-of-humankind)).

> A common problem in git is finding the commit that deleted a file. [The mechanism for doing this in a local repo is well-known](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6839398/find-when-a-file-was-deleted-in-git):
> 
> `git log -- path/to/deleted/file`
> 
> There are variations on this command to control how hard you want to look, and which branch you want to look in, but that’s the basic idea.
> 
> But what if you want to do this on a hosted repo?
> 
> For GitHub, you can ask for the history of a file in a branch, and the secret is that GitHub doesn’t mind when you specify a deleted file.

> For example, to find the commit that deleted `Samples/ApplicationData/cs/Scenario5_DataChangedEvent.xaml.cs` from the main branch of the UWP Samples Repo at [https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/), you can go to [https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/commits/main/Samples/ApplicationData/cs/Scenario5_DataChangedEvent.xaml.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/commits/main/Samples/ApplicationData/cs/Scenario5_DataChangedEvent.xaml.cs)
