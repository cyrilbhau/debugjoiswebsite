* [Transcript: Why you should take more risks, with Nate Silver](https://on.ft.com/3Tzxjvk) #risk
* Two podcasts with completely opposite viewpoints about Yuval Noah Hariri landed in my podcast feed #harari #anthropology
	* [367. A Brief History of Apocalypse - This Machine Kills](https://lnns.co/v-bIRioU8lC)- This podcast uses an article in The Atlantic ([Yuval Noah Harari’s Apocalyptic Vision - The Atlantic](https://archive.ph/jU618)) to critically deconstruct Harari's writing and cult of personality. It is actually quite hard to find reviews of his books online that are written by actual anthropologists in the field. But I did find one of his book Sapiens a long time ago ([A Reductionist History of Humankind — The New Atlantis](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/a-reductionist-history-of-humankind)). Graeber and Wengrow (who co-wrote _The Dawn of Everything_) have been critical of him as well ([David Graeber vs Yuval Harari: Exploding the myth of how civilisation began | Middle East Eye](https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/david-graeber-vs-yuval-harari-forgotten-cities-myths-how-civilisation-began))

* Speed ran a couple of Cal Newport podcasts.
	* [This Idea Will Make You Unstoppable.

[How Netflix won the streaming wars](https://on.ft.com/3ZuGHEr) - Good account of how Netflix turned it around after losing milliions of subscribers in 2022, and then going on to make changes such as capping production costs, cracking down on password sharing, introducing an ad-tier and exploring other forms of programming.

[GitHub trick to find the commit that deleted a file - The Old New Thing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20240909-00/?p=110234) #git #github

> A common problem in git is finding the commit that deleted a file. [The mechanism for doing this in a local repo is well-known](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6839398/find-when-a-file-was-deleted-in-git):
> 
> `git log -- path/to/deleted/file`
> 
> There are variations on this command to control how hard you want to look, and which branch you want to look in, but that’s the basic idea.
> 
> But what if you want to do this on a hosted repo?
> 
> For GitHub, you can ask for the history of a file in a branch, and the secret is that GitHub doesn’t mind when you specify a deleted file.
> 
> https://github.com/⟦user⟧/⟦project⟧/commits/⟦branch⟧/⟦path/to/deleted/file⟧
> 
> For example, to find the commit that deleted `Samples/ApplicationData/cs/Scenario5_DataChangedEvent.xaml.cs` from the main branch of the UWP Samples Repo at [https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/), you can go to [https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/commits/main/Samples/ApplicationData/cs/Scenario5_DataChangedEvent.xaml.cs](https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/commits/main/Samples/ApplicationData/cs/Scenario5_DataChangedEvent.xaml.cs)

#### Switching nvim configs using NVIM_APPNAME
I have always wanted to experiment with exotic nvim configs without disturbing my current config. Turns out it is really easy to do by setting the NVIM_APPNAME environment variable which automatically changes the subfolder under `~/.config` that nvim looks for to read the config. Here is a video which walks through the feature in details #nvim

#### You Were Born To Run - Podcast notes
I got around to reading the transcript of the podcast, to get a bit deeper: [You Were Born to Run - The Art of Manliness](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-art-of-manliness/you-were-born-to-run-r-zYxILE5oH/) Some notes below

[Ethnography and ethnohistory support the efficiency of hunting through endurance running in humans - PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38740986/)

> Humans have two features rare in mammals: our locomotor muscles are dominated by fatigue-resistant fibres and we effectively dissipate through sweating the metabolic heat generated through prolonged, elevated activity. A promising evolutionary explanation of these features is the endurance pursuit (EP) hypothesis, which argues that both traits evolved to facilitate running down game by persistence. However, this hypothesis has faced two challenges: running is energetically costly and accounts of EPs among late twentieth century foragers are rare. While both observations appear to suggest that EPs would be ineffective, we use foraging theory to demonstrate that EPs can be quite efficient. We likewise analyse an ethnohistoric and ethnographic database of nearly 400 EP cases representing 272 globally distributed locations. We provide estimates for return rates of EPs and argue that these are comparable to other pre-modern hunting methods in specified contexts. EP hunting as a method of food procurement would have probably been available and attractive to Plio/Pleistocene hominins.

Snippet from the podcast about why we continue to run despite our modern lives not requiring endurance pursuits like in our evolutionary past.

> Speaker 1: Almost it's almost there. But I think what I would say is so these sort of culturally defined sources of meaning are created by society. So it's no longer specific to the action of running. It's not that like we were born to have that cultural experience. So there are lots of ways to obtain meaning and and some people get that from, you know, lifting weights or, you know, climbing rocks or whatever the case may be.
> 
> But for some people for for many people running is or or for everyone running is one way that we can try to find meaning within our larger society and connect with something that that I think it's not just about, oh, you know, my sweat glands are so good at this. I need to do this. I think for most of us today, the meaning is cultural more than evolutionary, but our body is well equipped to then step into this task that when we do it, all of a sudden there's certain brain chemicals that are produced that that are probably a legacy of this Born to Run idea, you know, the the running high kind of stuff, which is so that's an that's an interesting I guess we haven't talked about that it's like if you look at when you go for a run or when you do any exercise your brain produces endocannabinoids, which is the brain's internal version of cannabis, and it makes people feel good. But it's the specific production of these endocannabinoids tends to peak at a sort of moderate sustained intensity. You don't get a ton if you're just, like, walking.
> 
> You don't get a ton if you're sprinting. But if you're at this sort of persistence hunting pace, then there's this feeling of well-being that you may get. And animals that are also well adapted to run long distances like dogs, they also get these endocannabinoids, whereas other animals, like, in one of the studies, it was ferrets that aren't good at running long distances, they don't get this endocannabinoid basis. So there there are these holdovers from our evolutionary past that conspire to make running and activities like it feel good because we've evolved to have that cue to tell us you're doing the right thing
