Not of lot of time on the computer because of travel, but lots of podcasts!

* [Why is Instagram Reels so unhinged? - Power User with Taylor Lorenz](https://lnns.co/oD0L_lJKCyY) - quite an indepth analysis of the Instagram algorithm and how it doesn't seem to work as well as TikTok or YouTube

* [How will the US presidential debate shape the rest of the race?](https://www.economist.com/podcasts/2024/09/13/how-will-the-us-presidential-debate-shape-the-rest-of-the-race) - a thorough analysis of the presidential debate between Trump and Harris from different angles from The Economist. Loved the linguistic analysis towards the end.
