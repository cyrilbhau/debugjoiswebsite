 FT Review of ‘Want’, an anthology of sexual fantasies collected by Gillian Anderson [What do women really want?](https://on.ft.com/47uvMfQ) #books #sex 

> sex is — as it has ever been — big business, and no doubt Want will fly off the shelves. We seem to be in a mini-boom of sex-positive books written by women, aimed at women, that show women attempting to redefine the boundaries of permission within what is still the patriarchy. Among those published this year are Miranda July’s novel All Fours, about a middle-aged woman’s erotic reclamation; Molly Roden Winter’s memoir of her open marriage, More, and Marianne Power’s Love Me! One Woman’s Search for a Different Happy Ever After. Go for it, girls, is the message. No need for any inhibitions.
