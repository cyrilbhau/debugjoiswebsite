 FT Review of ‘Want’, an anthology of sexual fantasies collected by Gillian Anderson [What do women really want?](https://on.ft.com/47uvMfQ) #books #sex 

> sex is — as it has ever been — big business, and no doubt Want will fly off the shelves. We seem to be in a mini-boom of sex-positive books written by women, aimed at women, that show women attempting to redefine the boundaries of permission within what is still the patriarchy. Among those published this year are Miranda July’s novel All Fours, about a middle-aged woman’s erotic reclamation; Molly Roden Winter’s memoir of her open marriage, More, and Marianne Power’s Love Me! One Woman’s Search for a Different Happy Ever After. Go for it, girls, is the message. No need for any inhibitions.

Highly recommend going back and reading earlier posts in this newsletter - very dense and rewarding.

#### Ellie Anderson on Beauvoir

[Ellie Anderson, Beauvoir on Non-Monogamy in Loving Relationships - PhilArchive](https://philarchive.org/rec/ANDBON) - Ellie Anderson is my favorite philosopher online, and she also has a great podcast. #love #non-monogamy #ethical-nonmonogamy 

The whole paper is worth reading. But the section Beauvoir's Critique of Monogamous Marriage is especially worth reading. A multi-paragraph quote below that I especially liked.

> Yet she also occasionally writes positively about the possibilities of authentic monogamy and marriage. In The Second Sex, she writes that men might accept women as equal partners rather than expecting the woeful asymmetry of heterosexual marriage at her time of writing. She thinks this will likely involve both partners working outside the home so that the wife is 'self-sufficient' (Beauvoir 2011: 733). If this is the case, and 'the man is scrupulously well-intentioned, lovers and spouses can attain perfect equality in undemanding generosity' (Beau-voir 2011: 733). This passage, then, suggests that she thinks an authentically loving marriage can be achieved.
> 
> It may remain in question, however, whether this conclusion is consistent with other aspects of Beauvoir's critique. One might say that monogamy is inauthentic because it restricts freedom: namely, one's freedom to pursue multiple relationships at once. Yet there are two problems with concluding from her account here that monogamy is necessarily inauthentic because it restricts one's freedom to explore other relationships. For one, Beauvoir's existentialism recognizes that humans have limited time and resources to devote to various projects: we must always choose, and choosing involves closing off possibilities. Thus, from an existential perspective, it seems that one could state that monogamy, when freely chosen rather than consented to out of an uncritical respect for established social norms or fear of being left alone, is merely one of many valid ways to choose authentically for oneself.
> 
> Additionally, part of Beauvoir's problem with monogamy is its failure to account for the changing nature of the self over time. But this arguably only holds for lifelong monogamous commitments, such as marriage. If one makes a short-term commitment that one freely renews over time, this would seem to be no more inauthentic than a renewable commitment to non-monogamy. Moreover, on a practical level, Beauvoir's own pact with Sartre shows that one may be monogamous in practice while committing to the value of non-monogamy. In the same way that one can be single and living an authentic life, one may find oneself in just one relationship at a time while open to other relationships in principle. Beauvoir's account of agreeing to the 'two-year lease' with Sartre is suggestive on this point. Recall that, though they agreed not to prevent one another from pursuing other relationships, they treated it as self-evident that they would not pursue other relationships for the initial period of their 'pact' (Beauvoir 1992: 24). While she does not elaborate on this point, the idea of giving themselves completely to their relationship initially sounds like what polyamorists describe as 'new relationship energy' (NRE), or the experience of infatuation early in relationships that incentivizes lovers to spend maximal time and emotional resources on one lover. While remaining committed to the principle of non-monogamy, Beauvoir and Sartre recognized that establishing their relationship involved practising monogamy for a time.
