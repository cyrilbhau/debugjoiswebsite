Podcasts: #podcasts :
* [Apple’s Big Reveals, OpenAI’s Multi-Step Models, and Firefly Does Video](https://lnns.co/wG9dzTpuClL)
* Two Odd Lots podcasts
	* [Adam Tooze on the Big Misconceptions of the Chinese Economy](https://lnns.co/Pio4hvKzFN_) - ostensibly the podcast is about China but Adam Tooze being Adam Tooze it veers into lots of related territory. I liked the section on German industrial policy, especially.
	* [Lots More With Isabella Weber on Draghi's EU Competitiveness Report](https://lnns.co/Se6Wf_Ga7K1)
* [073 - Sleep Science: What Actually Matters - FAREWELL](https://lnns.co/xe3SK75gN9l) - This is a good complement to the NYT article about sleepmaxxing that I was reading a couple of days ago.
* [Climate Fiction Origins: J.G. Ballard's Visionary Worlds](https://lnns.co/VFiB7SLDbE8) - I had heard about J.G. Ballard before, but this article went into quite a bit of depth about him. I found his interview quite insightful, and the quotes from his works were great as well. I will try to put out quotes from the transcript when I get time.
* [You Were Born to Run - The Art of Manliness](https://lnns.co/opnIJW9a7ZD) - Yet another transcriptworthy podcast. This is a pretty good history/anthropology of running that covers quite a lot of ground - from the evolutionary origins of running to the causes underlying the cultural phenomenon that it has become in recent times.

Neofetch is no longer being maintained because the maintainer "took up farming", and fastfetch, NerdFetch and hyfetch are good alternatives.

It seems like the best way to work with Google Drive synced Obsidian vault simultaneously from the desktop and my Android phone is to use the FastSync app. Details in this Reddit comment: [Can't access Google Drive via Obsidian app - how can I sync my vaults using Drive? : r/ObsidianMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/oiqk48/cant_access_google_drive_via_obsidian_app_how_can/?share_id=DQOkxrTK5Uo3TglMcX7iT) #obsidian #android
