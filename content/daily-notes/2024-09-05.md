> 1. Full-text search withÂ `tsvector`
> 2. Semantic search withÂ `pgvector`
> 3. Fuzzy matching withÂ `pg_trgm`
> 4. Bonus: BM25

**Luxury Beliefs**:
- These are ideas that the wealthy use to signal status but do not bear the negative consequences of these beliefs, unlike lower-class communities. For instance, affluent people advocating for "defunding the police" may live in safer neighborhoods, while poorer communities suffer from increased crime.
- "Luxury beliefs have largely replaced luxury goods" in signifying cultural capital.
- Examples include discussions around abolishing the police or questioning traditional family structures, which elites advocate for, but they are often shielded from the consequences.
