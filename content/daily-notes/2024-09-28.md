The article above ☝🏽 reminded me of the article in posted on 2024-09-19 about the "mainstreaming of loserdom". The same phenomena, but a different take here.

> Earlier this month, after a particularly long week and amid a very unserious battle with a pesky head cold, I turned to a friend and asked the question: “Do you ever wish you could take two weeks of annual leave from seeing or socialising with anyone?” She said she thinks about it often. As a usually ‘social person’ (my mum had to pry my hands from the playground at the end of each school day), my longing to spend every spare moment lying vertically at home has been a relatively new but increasing occurrence. I cherish my deeply fulfilling friendships, and I strongly believe in the importance of nurturing my relationships even when I’m tired. Still, I often feel like I have no hours to spare after showing up for all of the week’s commitments. I realised I wasn’t craving space away from loved ones, but the ability to feel energised enough to relish in their company – more time to _truly_ enjoy my friendships.

> [According to a new study](https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/american-loneliness-paradox/) led by Natalie Pennington of Colorado State University, my exhausted friend and I are not alone. Americans have an average of four or five friends (a number that has held steady since the 70s) but now only spend three hours per week with them, compared to six hours a decade ago. In other words, the growing loneliness epidemic is not about people having fewer friends (less than four per cent of respondents reported having no friends at all), it’s more just a byproduct of “having no time” to foster deeper connections.

This article is so relatable. The whole thing is worth reading in full, but some quotes below

> A big part of my early thirties has been about learning which ladders I have no interest in climbing and accepting the shift in identity that comes with this realization. Next to the corporate ladder is the relationship ladder, with milestones like _become exclusive, move in together, open a joint bank account, get married, have kids_. The two enable each other, promising the vaunted security of liberal capitalism: your corporate job provides for your family, and your family compels you to work harder at your job so you can earn a bigger paycheck.

> Attachment theory can be useful for understanding why people behave the way they do in intimate relationships, but over-reliance on it runs the risk of diagnosing any deviation from accepted convention as a problem. For example, if someone doesn’t want to get married, attachment theory might posit a fear of commitment as the culprit, a telltale sign of avoidant attachment. While this may be the case, it’s not the only possible explanation. If we accept, instead, the premise that there’s nothing wrong with not wanting to get married, then maybe the problem isn’t internal. Maybe the _system_ we subscribe to isn’t serving our needs.
> 
> …
> 
> We all carry wounds, often unrecognized, from our past. No one is a clean slate. When triggered, we resort to coping mechanisms that once served us in childhood but have become maladaptive, even self-sabotaging. When this happens, it can feel like we’re being walloped by the past, caught in the same conflict over and over. But it does get easier. The patterns become more recognizable. You learn how to listen to your emotions. But I don’t think you ever reach a point where you feel like nothing could possibly go wrong. “Secure attachment” as an end goal is a fantasy. The work of being in a relationship with someone is to learn to love each other better _as we change_, and that’s an unending endeavor.

> In choosing not to climb the relationship ladder, I’m also giving up the illusion of security that it promises and any claim I might have on another person’s heart. For the first time, I can truly say I’m at peace with it.

Quote from Ester Perel's book _Mating in Captivity_: #relationships 

> We seek a steady, reliable anchor in our partner. Yet at the same time we expect love to offer a transcendent experience that will allow us to soar beyond our ordinary lives. The challenge for modern couples lies in reconciling the need for what’s safe and predictable with the wish to pursue what’s exciting, mysterious, and awe-inspiring.

Stumbled upon another amazing article from the same newsletter as the above post: [spontaneity - by Elaine - manners & mystery](https://elainewrites.substack.com/p/spontaneity) #leisure

> I want to spend my days writing, reading, painting, taking long walks, acting, and practicing piano. Basically, I want to live like an 18th century aristocrat. Unfortunately, I lack the means to do so. A life of leisure is a luxury few of us can afford, but that doesn’t mean we can’t spend our time in a way that’s more satisfying.
