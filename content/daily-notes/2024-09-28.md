The article above ‚òùüèΩ reminded me of the article in posted on 2024-09-19 about the "mainstreaming of loserdom". The same phenomena, but a different take here.

> Earlier this month, after a particularly long week and amid a very unserious battle with a pesky head cold, I turned to a friend and asked the question: ‚ÄúDo you ever wish you could take two weeks of annual leave from seeing or socialising with anyone?‚Äù She said she thinks about it often. As a usually ‚Äòsocial person‚Äô (my mum had to pry my hands from the playground at the end of each school day), my longing to spend every spare moment lying vertically at home has been a relatively new but increasing occurrence. I cherish my deeply fulfilling friendships, and I strongly believe in the importance of nurturing my relationships even when I‚Äôm tired. Still, I often feel like I have no hours to spare after showing up for all of the week‚Äôs commitments. I realised I wasn‚Äôt craving space away from loved ones, but the ability to feel energised enough to relish in their company ‚Äì more time to¬†_truly_¬†enjoy my friendships.

> [According to a new study](https://www.zmescience.com/science/news-science/american-loneliness-paradox/)¬†led by Natalie Pennington of Colorado State University, my exhausted friend and I are not alone. Americans have an average of four or five friends (a number that has held steady since the 70s) but now only spend three hours per week with them, compared to six hours a decade ago. In other words, the growing loneliness epidemic is not about people having fewer friends (less than four per cent of respondents reported having no friends at all), it‚Äôs more just a byproduct of ‚Äúhaving no time‚Äù to foster deeper connections.
