Old Man S02E04 #tv - kinda starting to get bored with this.

Neat idea to explicitly allowlist paths and extensions in a `.gitignore` file, to avoid slop like `.DS_Store` getting accidentally checked in because it wasn't there. #git 

```
*

!src/
!*.rs
!*.toml
!*.lock
```

There is also the global gitignore file one could use: [An example global gitignore file · GitHub](https://gist.github.com/jacobtomlinson/aace65a6920e44348d501da5e13a5a17)

**Update:** There is now a blog post about this: https://rgbcu.be/blog/gitignore/

#### ADHD and Evolutionary Mismatch
This tweet is a pretty interesting take. However it's slightly offbase #adhd #evo-psych #evolution

I discovered the concept of evolutionary mismatch when I was trying to better understand my own struggles with ADHD. Even though this tweet-sized post makes some useful points, I would recommend anyone interested in exploring this further to go directly to this book, which is surprisingly accessible: [Evolutionary Psychiatry: Current Perspectives on Evolution and Mental Health: 9781316516560: Medicine & Health Science Books @ Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Evolutionary-Psychiatry-Current-Perspectives-Evolution/dp/1316516563)

For ADHD specifically, Chapter 5 titled _Hunter Gatherers, Mismatch and Mental Disorder_ is especially useful. 

The On Humans podcast interviewed Nikhil Chaudhary, which is where I discovered the concept of evolutionary mismatch and the whole field of Evolutionary Psychiatry: [Mental Health Bonus | The Origins of ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression \~ Nikhil Chaudhary | On Humans Podcast \~ Science & Philosophy of What It Means To Be Human](https://on-humans.podcastpage.io/episode/mental-health-bonus-the-origins-of-adhd-anxiety-and-depression-nikhil-chaudhary)

There is also this video interview with Nikhil Chaudhary from the Evolving Psychiatry podcast:

[Coffee badging: the new flexible work trend](https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/coffee-badging-work-trend/827112) #work 

Introducing ‘coffee badging’, a new [workplace trend](https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/careers/hush-trips-work-trend/763359) that sees people in flexible work environments coming into the office just for their morning coffee, getting a metaphorical ‘badge’ (think Girl Guides or Scouts), before heading off to complete their work for the day elsewhere. 

“Coffee badging is the practice of turning up at your office to show your face briefly before escaping back to your default option of working from home,” explains [Liz Villani](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liz-villani-beyourselfatwork-b404601/?originalSubdomain=uk), founder of #BeYourselfAtWork and the #iAM global movement. “It’s [presenteeism](https://www.stylist.co.uk/tag/presenteeism) in the most fleeting of methods.”

[The curse of the cool girl novelist - New Statesman](https://archive.is/20231206182140/https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2023/09/curse-cool-girl-novelist-parody) #culture #books 

A tad unfair, but it's a funny characterisation.

> While the silly novels of the 19th century were “frothy” and “prosy”, their heroines inclined to “rise to a lofty strain of rhetoric”, cool girl novels are uniformly spare, and their depressed protagonists hardly speak at all. If Eliot’s silly novelists forged their prose style in rooms adorned with silk ribbon and taffeta trim, the cool girl novelists of today write from white Scandi-inspired rooms, their prose monochromatically dull.
> 
> The anti-heroine of these novels is usually a PhD student (or at least an MA), crucially distinguishing her from the common undergraduate masses. Her knowledge of intersectional theory has left her crippled by a near constant anxiety about power imbalances and inequality. She is also perpetually worried, to the point of exhaustion, nay burnout, about the plight of the individual under capitalism. Her eyes have an unmanned look about them, while her brain anxiously jumps from one devastating indictment of our society to the next. Words like ecocide and patriarchy thrum inside her skull.
