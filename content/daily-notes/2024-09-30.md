Neat idea to explicitly allowlist paths and extensions in a `.gitignore` file, to avoid slop like `.DS_Store` getting accidentally checked in because it wasn't there. #git

#### ADHD and Evolutionary Mismatch
This tweet is a pretty interesting take. However it's slightly offbase #adhd #evo-psych #evolution

I discovered the concept of evolutionary mismatch when I was trying to better understand my own struggles with ADHD. Even though this tweet-sized post makes some useful points, I would recommend anyone interested in exploring this further to go directly to this book, which is surprisingly accessible: [Evolutionary Psychiatry: Current Perspectives on Evolution and Mental Health: 9781316516560: Medicine & Health Science Books @ Amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com/Evolutionary-Psychiatry-Current-Perspectives-Evolution/dp/1316516563)

For ADHD specifically, Chapter 5 titled _Hunter Gatherers, Mismatch and Mental Disorder_ is especially useful. 

The On Humans podcast interviewed Nikhil Chaudhary, which is where I discovered the concept of evolutionary mismatch and the whole field of Evolutionary Psychiatry: [Mental Health Bonus | The Origins of ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression \~ Nikhil Chaudhary | On Humans Podcast \~ Science & Philosophy of What It Means To Be Human](https://on-humans.podcastpage.io/episode/mental-health-bonus-the-origins-of-adhd-anxiety-and-depression-nikhil-chaudhary)

There is also this video interview with Nikhil Chaudhary from the Evolving Psychiatry podcast:
