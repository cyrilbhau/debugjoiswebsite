Went to the AI demos at HSR Hacker House. Good vibes. May apply for the next round to work more on podscript.

Really nice note taking app by one of the guys who works on Cursor: [Type Here | App](https://typehere.app/).  The cool thing is how it uses the browser's localstorage and IndexedDB to persist notes on the client. One of the things I wanna do is explore a seamless way to periodically backup from the browsers local storage to something more durable in the cloud.

First Onam Sadhya of the season. Hope to end up in at least 1-2 more ‚úåüèΩ.
