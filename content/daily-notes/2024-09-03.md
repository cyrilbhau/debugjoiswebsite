	* [070 - "Don't Shoot Yourself with The Second Arrow" - FAREWELL (podcast) | Listen Notes](https://lnns.co/zsDhGtA1CEa): _There's a Buddhist parable that gets at this idea very well and it is the parable of the second arrow and it's usually told like this. Imagine you're walking through the woods and you get struck with an arrow. You have the pain of getting shot by the arrow. Not fun. Doesn't seem great. In addition to the physical pain, you'd probably find your mind also racing and wondering oh my god who shot me? Are they gonna shoot me again? Am I gonna bleed out? Is this a poisoned arrow? Will I ever make it back to my family? And frankly, those are all pretty reasonable worries and thoughts. It's probably what I'd be thinking if I were ever to be shot with an arrow. But it is a parable and so it is exaggerated for effect. The lesson is that when our mind begins to tell ourselves all these stories about what is going to happen as a result of this physical pain, we shoot ourselves with a second arrow._
