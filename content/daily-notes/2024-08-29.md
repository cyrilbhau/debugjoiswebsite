[Why are so many straight men such bad conversationalists? | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/64456/1/why-are-straight-men-so-bad-at-conversation) #culture

> Sound familiar? I’m not surprised. The ‘conversation gap’ between men and women within the context of heterosexual relationships is a well-documented phenomenon: sociolinguistics professor Deborah Tannen popularised the idea that men and women approach conversations differently in her 1990 book [_You Just Don’t Understand_](https://www.deborahtannen.com/you-just-dont-understand), where she argued that men seek to negotiate and cement their status in the social hierarchy, often “exhibiting knowledge and skill by holding centre stage through verbal performance”. By contrast, women aim to develop connections, exploiting questions to “discover similarities and matching experiences”.

> Many factors can contribute to this ingrained sense of male entitlement in conversation, including upbringing and family dynamics, cultural differences, and individual communication styles. But dominant, pervasive gender norms remain the main culprit.

> Arguably the ‘conversation gap’ has only widened in the [post-pandemic milieu](https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-zers-cant-flirt-could-make-dating-better-2024-7). Prolonged isolation stunted the social skills required to form meaningful connections, further contributing to the ongoing epidemic of [male loneliness](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/57460/1/straight-men-no-friends-toxic-masculinity-loneliness-u-ok). “Guys don’t always have a tight-knit group to call their own and even when they do, they’re not having deep conversations in the same way women do. But it’s still something they crave, as human beings. This is why, when women give them a platform during dates, they tend to treat them like a captive audience, an opportunity to offload any emotions they don’t always have the chance to process,” Lalli said.
