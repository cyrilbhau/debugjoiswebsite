> The researchers conclude that "language models exhibit archaic stereotypes about speakers of AAE that most closely agree with the most-negative human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded, dating from before the civil rights movement."

[Why are so many straight men such bad conversationalists? | Dazed](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/64456/1/why-are-straight-men-so-bad-at-conversation) #culture

> Sound familiar? I’m not surprised. The ‘conversation gap’ between men and women within the context of heterosexual relationships is a well-documented phenomenon: sociolinguistics professor Deborah Tannen popularised the idea that men and women approach conversations differently in her 1990 book [_You Just Don’t Understand_](https://www.deborahtannen.com/you-just-dont-understand), where she argued that men seek to negotiate and cement their status in the social hierarchy, often “exhibiting knowledge and skill by holding centre stage through verbal performance”. By contrast, women aim to develop connections, exploiting questions to “discover similarities and matching experiences”.

> Many factors can contribute to this ingrained sense of male entitlement in conversation, including upbringing and family dynamics, cultural differences, and individual communication styles. But dominant, pervasive gender norms remain the main culprit.

> Arguably the ‘conversation gap’ has only widened in the [post-pandemic milieu](https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-zers-cant-flirt-could-make-dating-better-2024-7). Prolonged isolation stunted the social skills required to form meaningful connections, further contributing to the ongoing epidemic of [male loneliness](https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/57460/1/straight-men-no-friends-toxic-masculinity-loneliness-u-ok). “Guys don’t always have a tight-knit group to call their own and even when they do, they’re not having deep conversations in the same way women do. But it’s still something they crave, as human beings. This is why, when women give them a platform during dates, they tend to treat them like a captive audience, an opportunity to offload any emotions they don’t always have the chance to process,” Lalli said.

[If Your World Is Not Enchanted, You're Not Paying Attention](https://theconvivialsociety.substack.com/p/if-your-world-is-not-enchanted-youre)

> * "Enchantment is just the measure of the quality of our attention."
> * "To speak of attention in this manner, as a patient waiting on the world to disclose itself, recalls how Simone Weil insisted that attention is a form of active passivity. 'We do not obtain the most precious gifts by going in search of them,' she insisted, 'but by waiting for them.'"
> * "Just because something is available instantly to vision does not mean that it is available instantly to consciousness."

Had to look up options for `fzf#run` for an nvim I was trying to build: [fzf/README-VIM.md at master · junegunn/fzf · GitHub](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/blob/master/README-VIM.md#fzfrun)

The actual plugin is here: [GitHub - deepakjois/nvim-postit: capture post-it like notes with nvim](https://github.com/deepakjois/nvim-postit). I mainly wrote it to scratch a tiny itch I had and also to try out the Composer feature to see how functional it was in helping me build entire projects. Overall, the experience was a bit mid because I got stuck at this stupid bug. I should have just googled it or something, instead of continuing to persist with the AI like I did. But still it was a great learning experience. The AI also put out a pretty good scaffolding that I would have struggled to come up with so quickly. #vim #neovim

Saw the first shl Cursor video. The plan is to at least watch session 2 and session 4.
