[Benefits of psychedelics: Can they teach us about¬†the search for meaning in life? | Vox](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23972716/psychedelics-meaning-science-psychedelic-mushrooms-ketamine-psilocybin-mysticism?ueid=7aaabf0d71933f976c55b0f4b1bd9f88)

Lot of stuff in the article ‚òùüèΩ. I will need to read it again to process it fully. Some disjointed quotes below

> In 2017,¬†[Katrin Preller](https://www.uzh.ch/cmsssl/dppp/en/cfpr/researchgroups/external-research-groups/pharmaco-neuroimaging-and-cognitive-emotional-processing/team/preller.html), a neuropsychologist at the University of Zurich,¬†[published the first experiment](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(16)31510-X?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS096098221631510X%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)¬†to test the specific contribution of these serotonin receptors in the subjective effects of LSD in humans. Participants listened to three kinds of music: music that they found meaningless (often free jazz ‚Äî no disrespect, Sun Ra fans), music they had preselected as highly meaningful to them, and ‚Äúneutral‚Äù music that was similar to their preselected songs but that they had never heard before.
> 
> They listened to each set on three different occasions: once while sober; once on LSD, which, they reported, made all three pieces of music more meaningful; and once on a combination of LSD and ketanserin, a drug that blocks the serotonin receptor so psychedelic molecules can‚Äôt dock there. The idea was to see if LSD still produces elevated levels of meaningfulness even when it can‚Äôt interact with the serotonin receptor.
> 
> The result? Blocking that receptor completely canceled the subjective effects of LSD; participants might as well have been sober. Preller‚Äôs findings helped establish that these receptors are critical to the noetic quality. No receptor activation, no extra meaningfulness.
> 
> But explaining psychedelic meaningfulness via the activation of serotonin receptors is like saying that turning the keys in the ignition explains what makes a car go. Once the receptors are activated, there‚Äôs a whole lot of under-the-hood activity that‚Äôs important to understand the mechanisms of meaning.

> No matter how strong a psychedelic trip can be, connection remains a critical aspect of meaning-making. Psychedelics may help us forge new connections more easily ‚Äî but the rest, like designing a society that does the same, is up to us.

Today I used the gh cli for the first time to create a github repo from a pre-existing folder:

```
gh repo create --private --source=.
```

So much more convenient than using the web interface.

#### nvim exploration
I am a pretty competent vim user. But I hadn't explored nvim deeply so far. My vim config was in VimScript till recently and I hadn't made use of LSP and TreeSitter related features much. I finally decided to setup my nvim from scratch, and started by watching some YouTube videos #nvim #tools

- [0 to LSP : Neovim RC From Scratch - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE) - This video from ThePrimagen was helpful in understanding the basics of a typical nvim setup. However, it uses packer for plugin management which is unmaintained. However, this video also links to kickstart.vim, which is very useful: [GitHub - nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim: A launch point for your personal nvim configuration](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim)
- [The Only Video You Need to Get Started with Neovim - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8C0Cq9Uv9o) - This video introduces kickstart.vim and also goes through some basics which was really helpful. The kickstarter repo is explicitly designed for new Neovim users and is extremely well documented: [kickstart.nvim/init.lua at master ¬∑ nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim ¬∑ GitHub](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim/blob/master/init.lua)

I watched these videos and used the `NVIM_APPNAME` environment variable to start a fresh nvim config without disturbing my current setup.
